But what Brice didn't count on was a face from the past turning his world upside down.

Lena Razzi a single mother to a little boy named Nicholas got a job as a replacement for a month at B&H Advanced Engineering but what she was not told was that she would be working for an old flame....the one and only, Brice Henderson.

When Lena and Brice came face to face it was a surprise to them both, the chemistry and attraction were still very much alive....The former still loved the latter ans vice versa, they were both trying to stay away but to no avail.

Lena never told Brice about Nicholas cause she never wanted her son to feel rejected by his father. But when Brice found out about his existence, he regretted the choices he made in the past....Choosing success over family and relations.

There was no turning back the hands of time only looking forward to the future with Lena and Nicholas. ONE WHITE LIE was fascinating. Love Dominic Corisi, Trent and many more making an appearance.

This is my first book by Jeannette Winters, I'm thrilled that she's working with one of my favorite authors, Ruth Caredello and I can't wait for what they have in store for us with this amazing series.",Sweetest Love!!!,1449878400,

As they say all people change and Brice's change was not for the better.

It took long nights in a hospital room after some mixed feeling news and a meddling sister for him to learn the truth about Lena. Also, it took clearing a soul before death for him to get closure that held him in a place of stay and go, love from a distance or by her side.

These pantyhose by Veneziana comes in 3 different colors to choose from: Black, Grey and Navy.  I have the Grey one and it is really more of a dark Charcoal Color.  The material feels silky and luxurious.

The waistband is soft and comfortable and offer adequate control.  They are thicker than typical pantyhose so it is certainly more durable.  I appreciate that it is a product import from Italy and the size is true to one I typically purchase in the USA.

The material is super soft and very flattering, and it's easy to nurse discreetly in this top. It did take me a few tries to figure out how to get from fully covered to latched without flashing people nearby, but I pretty quickly figured out what worked for me and my baby, and now I don't even have to mess with nursing covers, which is great because my daughter refuses to nurse when covered (and I can hardly blame her). I'm rather large-chested (I honestly don't even know my breastfeeding bra size... I was a 40D pre-baby and those bras are too small now), so I've had a hard time finding nursing tops that are flattering, comfortable, discreet, and modest. This shirt is all of those things. And that's why I have four of them. :)

At my family's huge Christmas Eve party this year, I couldn't find an empty room to nurse my daughter, so we just found a corner and nursed there (see pic for that outfit). My sister came up and started talking to me and it took her a minute to realize I was breastfeeding, rather than just snuggling my sleepy baby.

I have several other styles of nursing tops and dresses, and this is by FAR my favorite.

These pantyhose by Veneziana comes in 3 different colors to choose from: Black, Natural and Cappucinno.  I have the Natural one and it is really more of a Nude Color.  The material feels silky and luxurious.

The waistband is soft and comfortable and offer adequate control.  They are sheer and opaque pantyhose that does not feel thin and easy to rip.  I appreciate that it is a product import from Italy and the size is true to one I typically purchase in the USA.

In conclusion, I rate this Women Pantyhose by Veneziana 5 out of 5 Stars. It is a comfortable and a quality product I recommend.

However, a few things prevent me from rating it higher than three stars. First, even with the adjustable straps (which are nice), the chest area is way too low. I'm nursing (one main reason I purchased this dress - it works well for that purpose) and am guessing my bra size to be a 36D, and there is no way I would wear this without something underneath. I wear a nursing bra that looks like a v-neck undershirt under it and it covers better that way. Then I pair it with a shrug and it looks nice.

The other issue I have with this design is that it's advertised as being red and white. It is so far from being red. It's pink, almost hot pink. I love the floral pattern and birds and everything else about the design, but I was seriously disappointed with the color and never would have bought it had I known it was pink. I just wear a red shrug over it and that makes the pink stand out less without clashing too much.

Essentially, it's a really nice dress if you know what to expect and work with it a bit. Not sheer (I tried a black bra under it and it did not show through), and very flattering. I actually bought another pattern of this dress a few weeks after buying this one because I liked the fit and design so much.","The fit on this is awesome, and I love the design",1471737600,

The visor is half vinyl, half plastic visor.  Not sure why. You can see this in the stock photo, and I should have noticed it before purchasing because its not what I would expect.

For some reason I decided I needed a Stormtrooper helmet to wear with my Utilikilt. I know... an odd combination to some, but makes perfect sense to me. I started looking for helmets here on Amazon and found the one I wanted. Only problem was it costs $150. I actually put it in my wish list to ponder whether I'd be willing to part with $150 for something that I wasn't going to wear that often. Finally decided to go with the economy version and bought this one.

First, as others have pointed out, the helmet that ships isn't the one in the photo. The black perforated eye areas actually have smoked gray plastic lenses (thankfully). Most everything else seems to be pretty accurate. Also, as others have pointed out, the helmet is in 4 pieces that don't stay together very well. You'll want some krazy glue or duct tape to make sure you're not fighting with it if you drop it or are a little rough on it. Even when it's put together I can see a bit of a gap on the seam that runs across the top. Not a huge deal as most people won't be able to see it, but it's there.

I'd still like to have one of the better helmets, but until somebody smacks me on the bum with a golden spoon I'll settle for the $22 version. BTW, I also ordered a Stormtrooper white t-shirt (that looks like the torso of the stormtrooper armor) to wear with it. Found it here on Amazon as well for about $20.",Economical option,1349222400,

I've never been a fan of the fancy, bulky basketball shoes of today, so for me, I always come back to the most basic of designs.

This particular shoe is from the Vietnam factory. Some people claim they know fake Converse shoes and say that if they have certain characteristics such as the loop on the tongue and the name Converse on the heel label that they must be counterfeits. I can assure you, these Converse are not fake. And even if they are, they would have to be the best fakes I've ever seen.

I've purchased Converse shoes from all sorts of retailers, on and offline, and they definitely differ in their manufacturing processes.

I first bought a pair of the low top shoes and decided that I wanted more ankle support and more style (I bought red ones which don't look great on guys). I ended up getting the high-tops in blue and I have to say that I am pretty happy now. They look way better so I don't have to feel embarrassed while wearing them. My squat form is significantly better now that I have a hard, flat sole to press into. The only bad thing is that the toe area is a bit narrow which is weird because the shoes are definitely not too small, if anything they're a little big.

SIZING (MUST READ)
Converse have really awkward sizing. They go by men's sizes and are half a size bigger. I'm an 8 in women's normal shoe. I'd normally be a 6 in men's sizes, but I risked it all and got half a size down just in case and THEY FIT PERFECTLY!! Just take your normal shoe size and go down two and a half sizes then that's your Converse size!

After I break them in and actually start wearing and tearing then, I will edit!

Edit: they are truly authentic to the brand. Not a knockoff as far a so can tell. They've lasted me a good long time. The only problem is, after a while when you start breaking them in, they start to hurt your feet. I have very wide feet at the base, which is a fashion lover's nightmare and because of these shoes, they gave me a corn on my ring toe, the toe that always sticks out the side of everything. Make sure to get some Dr. Scholls before you wear these for long periods of time like work, and school. I know I should've.

They don't provide good arch support and they are not the most comfortable show, but if you've worn them for years, you're probably used to this!!

If you're new to these shoes, Converse recommends getting a half size smaller and that advice is dead on. In the last 10 years or so, I've probably owned more than 20 different pairs (both high and low tops) purchased from many different sources and they all fit as expected when I get a half size smaller than my regular fit. Also, these shoes can sometimes feel like you're walking barefoot on the ground with a little padding. They aren't the worst shoe I've ever worn, but if you're looking for comfort for running, hiking or anything other than just walking around, you would be better off looking elsewhere. I find that Converse are mostly suited for style and design and they do it well! Despite that seemingly negative outlook, I love these shoes and wear them just about every day!! :) By the way, I have gone on multi-mile hikes with these and I can at least report that despite the lack of comfort, I survived without any blisters or any other issues other than tired feet.

I somewhat expected that due to the lower price from the seller I purchased from, that the quality would be different than that of which would come directly from Converse, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that they were exactly the same.

I think they are so comfortable! There is not much support, but since I've worn Keds for years, that doesn't really bother me. Converse are the only brand that don't rub the top of my big toe (around the nail) wrong - I can wear these for hours and not have my big toe hurt from the pressure of the top of the shoe. These are really cute - they are easily grunged down or can be dressed up with jeans and a cute shirt.

Bottom Line: There are few things that a 15 year old girl and her mom agree on - but we both like these shoes. We now have 3 pairs - light pink, white, and these black ones - and there are days when we argue over who gets to wear these. The only complaint I have is that every pair we own makes a cardboard popping sound when you walk. It's toward the ball of the foot - and when the shoe creases, there is an audible sound coming from the shoe. It's weird! I don't have any other shoes that do this, but all three pairs on the Converse do. It isn't bad enough that I'll stop wearing these - I love them! - but it's just something weird I've noticed and thought I would pass on, in case someone else has the same issue. I usually prefer going barefoot or just wearing socks - but I don't mind wearing these cool shoes. I can honestly say they are like wearing nothing - and my daughter says she agrees.

I usually choose the Hi-tops over the low style because sometimes the low style converse chaff a little at the back of the heel. Love both styles though, and Converse are my standard go-to shoes. Compared to cushioned running shoes the canvas keeps my feet cooler and I feel that the flat soles are better for my feet.

The sizing codes are a frequent source of confusion  they refer to the width only. Heres a quick guide: Narrow width is labeled as AA for women and C for men; Medium width is labeled as B for women and D for men; Wide shoes are labeled C or D for women and E for men; Extra wide is labeled E for women and EE for men. So, the medium with is most common, and they are often listed as B(M) for women and D(M) for men  in both cases the M stands for medium width. If you see UK after the size then its using the British width system, where the scale is C, D, E, F, G, H, with F bring the medium. Regarding whether its a womens size or mens the product info should state womens or mens (to avoid confusion with the width designations F or M). You can convert between US womens and mens sizes using the size chart link under the size. All of the UK sizes on Amazon are for UK men (same as US men in most cases) use the size chart if you want to see the equivalent size for US women. Still with me?!

You can now recycle your old Chucks at many Nike stores. The rubber will end up in tracks and playgrounds and the canvas in courts. Tip: their online store locator doesnt seem to be accurate in terms of listing stores with drop-off locations. I called a SF store that didn't have a recycling drop-off according to the website and it turned out that they actually did. So just call your local Nike store!

Theres a lot of evidence now that being closer to barefoot (minimal cushioning and little or no elevation at the heel) is much better for your feet. For example, research shows that when running in highly-cushioned modern running shoes, people are more likely to come down on their heels, and that these heel-strikes can be very high-impact (Lieberman, Nature 2010). Converse (along with Toms, Vibram, etc.) fit the bill for a close-to-barefoot shoe experience that will help keep your feet in shape. I once had an injury and was advised to wear arch-supporting insoles (which I wore in my Converse), but after recovery I took out the insoles (and only occasionally wear trainers with cushioned insoles) since the arch-support can lead to muscle atrophy and, ironically, loss of arches.

Perhaps its sad that Nike bought Converse in 2003 and moved production overseas (Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Thailand, and other locations) since Nike has a dark past when it comes to conditions in overseas factories. They are clearly working on this since the boycotts and outrage in the 90s, but the situation is still not perfect. As of 2011, two-thirds of the 168 factories failed to meet Nikes own standards for contract manufacturing (for example, there were reports of kicking, slapping, verbal abuse, and cruel work environments).  I think they are trying to be more transparent about worker conditions since theyve been under the spotlight more than some of their competitors (like Adidas). However, this clearly needs to change, and quickly.

In terms of materials, the canvas and synthetic rubber composition puts Converse above average in terms of sustainability. There is room for improvement of course. For example, Veja shoes (ranked higher on Rankabrand), have better worker conditions and are more eco-friendly; they're made using organic canvas and natural rubber thats sustainably harvested in the Chico Mendes reserve in the Amazon. I plan to try them out; they're available through an Amazon company called East Dane. Meanwhile, I love Converse as a product and hope that Nike will sort out their factory conditions situation. Nike (in 2011) claimed that they work working on it but that there was little that they could do to stop it. Lets get this straight, Nike: You buy the Converse company, shift production oversees where workers are abused and paid barely enough for food and lodging (less than $0.50 per hour), while maintaining the same price for the shoes to the consumer, and yet claim that you cant do anything about the conditions?  They are under contract to you  Im pretty sure you can do something.

So, overall Ill give it 5 stars gold stars for quality of the product and 4 green stars based on the social-ethical-environmental aspects of producing it. Converse was a great company but under Nike it loses a green star for poor working conditions in overseas factories. To put it into perspective (why do they only lose one star for bad conditions in some factories?), Nike are not as bad as some of the other big shoe companies, judging from available information. It looks like they are being transparent about the situation and their attempts to improve it (training managers, inspecting facilities, and revising subcontracts). Back in 2005 it became the first major apparel company to disclose factory locations and with that came some ugly stories about worker treatment, but perhaps not as ugly as the stories leaking out of more secretive companies like Adidas or Skechers.

I probably could have bought a small - not because it holds more, but because I don't think it would ""feel"" so small.  Regardless, everything that I tote around in a purse fits in here with TONS OF ROOM TO SPARE.  So, x-small is probably just fine but perhaps the aesthetics of the small bag would have been more my style.  I had neck/back surgery a year ago and pretty much just stick to messenger/cross body style bags.  This is by far the most comfortable one out there.  A word of caution - if you have a thick torso or larger than normal breasts, I'd rethink this due to the amount of give the strap has for a cross-body wear.

The one I ordered, and wanted, was the one pictured for the black. What I got was the one with the 2 little weird pockets on the outside. Unless you have a toy phone, or teeny tiny items, those pockets are worthless.  The only saving grace for those are the magnet closures. Very nice.

I have major back problems and chronic pain, and went on a search for a lighter everyday bag. This is perfect. I work in a casual office and can carry this everywhere without worry that it won't be suitable. I have a smaller clutch that I use for occasions that call for more formal attire.

Everything that was in my regular purse fits in here, with room to spare. What's more, this bag is noticeably lighter than my purse, which is precisely what I need

I agree with other reviewers that the inner water bottle holder is small. However, it does a great job of holding my sunglasses, which is more useful to me for daily use.

The only negative is the small, narrow size of the two outer pockets. I love the magnetic closures, but the so-called cell phone pocket is too small for my iPhone with Otterbox case. Instead, I use it for my little pill container. I haven't put anything in the smaller side pocket; seems to small for most things.

Other reviewers have rightly pointed out that this is NOT the classic bag, no matter what the advertisement says. It's the newer HBB-evo bag. That doesn't bother me, but it may bother someone else, so I think it's worth mentioning. If you look closely at the picture of the crimson bag, it shows only one flap pocket on the side. There are actually two.

I ordered the walnut one this time and was pleasantly surprised with the new long zipper inside.  My only peeve with this bag had been when I carried letters or notes, lists etc and they ended up scrunched as I looked for something else.  I know it says this space is for a tablet but it will be useful for containing papers also.  The band that holds the key clip has also been lengthened. It was not elasticized before either.  Sounds as if the product engineers are listening to their customers.  I am not sure about the split magnet pockets -  the smaller one is only about 2.5x2.5"".  The one meant for a cell phone is a little snug, but it will work - the opposite side also has a magnet now - that is usually where I put my phone for easy access;  the magnet is a good safeguard. Another improvement is in the pen pocket inside... it was divided before and too tight for some pens.  Now two medium pens slip in and out easily.
All in all I know I will be ordering more of the soil resistant distressed nylon AmeriBags.  Mine was fairly true to colour shown, if anything is a tiny bit darker, a very nice light brown colour.

UPDATE:  I still love the bag but I have had trouble getting out of automatic parking garages - i always tucked the little card in the small pocket after taking it from the machine.  Last time when I had to push the button (again) for help they told me that if I kept the card by a magnet it would not work..... Who knew that?  So now I make sure the card is elsewhere - but if you tuck it into a pants/jeans pocket, don't put it on the side you hold your bag on as there are magnets on both sides of the bag!  But since I mainly shop on Amazon, it is not such a huge issue...  Oh.. and now that small pocket is really useless.....any suggestions?

I am a matchy-matchy type person and very picky; purchasing a separate leather checkbook holder that did not match the wallet grain and color exactly was not an option for me.

Criteria are as follows (from most important to least):

1. Red leather
2. Matching checkbook holder
3. Clear ID holder NOT in zippered compartment... snap flap/fold over OK
4. 10+ credit card compartments that are NOT in a zippered compartment
5. At least 1 main zippered compartment for cash and another zippered compartment (within main zippered compartment) for change
6. Exterior pocket on the wallet... zipper preferred, no zipper OK

This wallet appeared to meet all of these criteria. It arrived within the estimated time frame, boxed, in perfect condition. Lovely red pebbled leather everywhere, all zippers slid nicely, and the snap fit securely in both holes. Everything seemed perfect until I tried to stuff my standard-sized Costco checks into the checkbook holder. The holder is at least 1/4"" too narrow; I had to chop off the sides of my checks to stuff them into the holder. Problem solved, right?

NO. I could not close the darned checkbook holder. When I forced the top flap over my checkbook, I had to use a rubber band to hold it down, and the zillion digit routing/account/check number at the bottom was in complete view. It looks ridiculous, and I am beyond irritated every time I have to write a check for Girl Scout Cookies, school pictures, etc. The only reason I am still using it (rubber band and all) is because the leather matches the wallet, and I need another 100 hours to do research to find a replacement wallet/checkbook holder. Why, WHY do wallet manufacturers make gross, cheap plastic wallets anyway? They should know that anyone old fashioned enough to use a checkbook on a regular basis will want REAL LEATHER. I looked at wallets from $20 to $200, and I couldn't find another that met all of my criteria that was 100% leather.

I have had Buxton wallets for years and years and this one was to be a replacement for the Cardex style I currently had (as I had not searched long enough to find the single cardex available too). One of the reasons this type wallet had always appealed to me was the double currency compartments. I have always kept my receipts in one area and my currency in the other. This wallet is advertised as having two compartments for bills but I was sorely disappointed that the red one I received only had one. The double compartment was the primary reason I wanted this wallet. I am also not sure it is leather as past Buxton wallets have always had it stamped on the leather somewhere. This one does not. Certainly the inside is plastic and it 'crackles' every time I open it. I am very unhappy with this wallet and the poor quality it seems Buxton has sunk to.  Had it not been a gift I would definitely return it.

Update: I finally got around to moving what I had in my old wallet to this new one. TERRIBLE! I only have a few cards and pictures I carry and even though it was not full, I could barely snap the wallet closed. When I put the coins in the coin holder the coin compartment would not stay closed. I took all but one coin out and it STILL would pop open when I snapped it.

I learned, as a young lady, if i wear a black dress, off black or black stockings form a continuous, slimming line.  The way things are today, black dress, bare legs, clunky, ugly shoes.  A woman should glide in heels, when dressed as if the outfit was crafted for her, not this clump, clump, bounce, bounce you see while walking in the pole dancer heels.

When your breasts are well supported and lifted it actually makes your waist look smaller! I took off one star because the quality and the fabric seems a bit cheap.

smash your breasts, instead of shaping them. Having seamed cups  allows your breasts to point outward instead of shoving them into
unnatural shape. The firm yet comfortable underwire also forms your breasts comfortably, preventing sagging and helps with a heavier bust.

Both items were recommended by a historic costuming blog. What I learned was that the horizontal center seam gives clothing from that time period the iconic shape, because it lifts your chest up and out, which elongates your torso in a natural way and makes you appear slightly thinner.

As for the product itself. The styling is cute and I like how the straps feel. The cup fabric feels very thin in your hand (there's no padding), but once you try it on, you'll see that is does provide sufficient coverage (color and shape). Also don't be alarmed if your chest looks a little ""pointy"" at first. That goes away with the weight of clothing on top of it.

I'm only giving this four stars because the seams of this bra can get a little uncomfortable/itchy, especially the center seam and the seam between the cup and band.

Mesmerized by their bust boosting miracle bras and fabulous looking models, I really never thought of straying. Problem was, their bras didn't fit me well, and definitely didn't provide me with the shape I desired. Their molded bras made me look saggy and lumpy, albeit bigger, but certainly not flattering. Plus, I was paying $40 to look this way, so I began to look for other options.

Enter the Bali Flower Bra.....  excellent support for my small bust and a more natural and feminine shape. No longer do I have one single rounded lump for a bust line, but two shapely, lifted and separated breasts! Best ""perk"" of this bra, a slimmer looking figure. Turns out proper support really smooths things out and emphasizes the waist line... can't argue with that!!
Now, at that other bra place, I generally wear a 34A but since that was not an option, I opted for a 32B and I'm glad I did. The tighter band is actually very comfortable and the cup is absolutely perfect (for once, with a little manipulation, I actually fully fill the cups!).

Now, if you're a fan of the rounded molded cups, stretchy straps and a seamless appearance, this might not be the bra for you. But if you're looking for a classic, slightly more conical look, and solid support, this bra is perfect. For those who, like me, enjoy wearing vintage clothing, look no further this is the 40s or (less severe) 50s silhouette you are looking for.

Finally, the lace. It's pretty, this is a pretty bra, but should you try it on straight out of the package and determine that it's a good fit but far too itchy, wash it once or twice--- you might change your mind.

I use this bra for specific purpose in specific garments when I was to have a true shelf type bra that hold your breasts up and out. Wearing blouses or dressed, or even casual tank tops, can make the breasts look droopy and thereby making you stomach area look thicker, and your torso shorter.  With this bra, the band does most of the work holding up the breasts so that the stress is not felt exclusively at the shoulder straps. No the straps are no elastic and it isn't due to being cheap. the do the job of holding the breasts in perfect place and they have soft fabric under the strap which makes them very comfortable. The only discomfort you should feel is you choose the wrong size because they don't have a lot of ""give."" They wear like iron and look great through many washes. I recommend never putting any bra through a dryer, nor using any fabric softener or high sudsing detergents that destroy the elastic. (sulfates causes sudsing) Try Charlie's Soap. You can purchase it through Earth Fare.  You will never regret it and it keeps the washer clean as a whistle, even the moving parts. What I also like about this bra is that there is no side breast because of the wonderful ""stays"" on either side of the bra. These push you side tissues towards the front. Just own it and throw your shoulders back and look great even if you aren't used to looking so good. You will be glad not to bounce all around if that is an issue for you i other bras. Don't let the less expensive price break distract you from getting this bra.  Inexpensive doesn't mean it is ""cheaply made.""

High-quality, daily shoes for me, which is saying a lot. I have pretty wide feet and practically no arches (thanks genetics!) so it's tough for me sometimes to find shoes that fit. When these shoes arrived, they felt pretty snug from a width standpoint, even at a 3E size, which was a new experience for me. Tennis shoes at a regular Medium width seem to fit me fine. However, after a day of wearing the shoes to break them in, I found incredibly comfortable shoes in this pair. The two-tone is very distinct and gets me compliments daily. I am impressed at the quality especially given the sub-$100 price. I plan to buy more of the same style/brand in the future, as these really impressed me.

Solution: Town Taupe shade of Hanes Silk Reflections Panty Hose to discreetly disguise the bruises without resorting to tights or hose that would be too dark for the dress color. Also Non Control Top to prevent half hour contortion sessions when visiting ladies room.
Caveat: Though lovely and sheer, comfortable and chic, I got just the one usage out of them because they launched into a massive run down the back of the left panty and upper leg as the reception drew to a close and I sat down (on a padded chair) after dancing. Unexpected, as nothing snagged on them up that high as to cause the run. It's as though they got overheated from the dancing and just gave up.
They fit nicely from the toes, over the ankles, and especially over the knees where some panty hose start to bind. I have wide thighs and was worried (at 5'4"") that the E/F size would fail me through this area and the crotch wouldn't snug all the way up. But it did fit, and continued up to completely cover the tummy, then stayed in place with no rolling down.
While I'm slightly disgruntled that, for the cost, these hose turned into a one night stand, they did serve the purpose and did the job well and stylishly. In the future, I'd invest in another pair and probably go with the same shade. I hope to get more use from the next pair.",Worked for the Occasion,1405555200,

It doesn't seem to help to loosen the straps, and I don't want to loosen all the way anyway because then the ladies aren't held up.  Very disappointed.",Terrible strap design,1474416000,

I have a very round shaped breast, the same width at the chest wall as at the nipple, and a rounded profile. (TMI? Yes, sorry. But it helps to know a bra reviewer's shape to compare how a bra might fit you! It's information I look for in other reviews.) The bra seems very lightweight for a full figure bra; it is more supportive than you might think, but not supportive enough. Part of the problem is the back only has two hooks, so on me, having the band snug enough for support means I get back fat over the band and under/behind the arm; on a more slender woman, this may not be an issue. But still, I prefer a wider back strap with more hooks. The cup is unlined and quite thin; I expected this to be an issue, because I am ""nipply"" at all times, but there was no show through under a fairly thin t-shirt. I felt this ran true to size, but the shape wasn't quite right for me. I filled up the cup fine, but couldn't adjust the hooks/straps/my breasts so that the center was flat against my chest. But there was still some unused cup at the very bottom, so it just isn't the right shape for my shape. (I can't explain it more clearly.) Also, the straps are stretchy. I realize the support mainly comes from the band, but I truly think stretchy straps have no place on a full-figure bra. I hate to bounce. It was very comfortable, and it gave a nice round shape under my shirt, but I'm sending it back.

Several years ago we moved quite far from a Jockey store and I had to try other brands, none of which were close to the quality and fit of the old Jockey for Her briefs.  I was happy to find Jockey underwear on Amazon but since the picture, the name and the description were obviously different from the original briefs I used to wear I ordered only one package of 3 pairs of the Elance briefs.

Boy, am I glad I only ordered one package!  I am terribly disappointed that they do not fit comfortably at all.

Now I will have to try to find another package of the Lollipop brand cotton briefs I bought a year or so ago.  They fit perfectly - just like the Jockey brand used to do.

I wore these for 2 weeks in Europe. They fit was great, the arch was comfortable and my feet did not hurt at the end of a long day of walking; they worked well in mud and grit,  and they were very water resistent. However, these mocs are DANGEROUS on wet, smooth rock/tile/cobble surfaces. They have no traction on such surfaces. The treads are not deep, so wet grass or leaves stick on the soles and turn the mocs into ice skates on wet surfaces. A few other comments related this slipping problem but I'd passed them over. You must be very careful. Choose another shoe if you know you will be in an area with stone surface sidewalks or streets.

Without doubt some ugly shoes: suede mocs that have grafted with a tentacled sea creature. They look bulky but are surprisingly light. They slip right on and suck your feet in. The insole is well padded- I have high arches and PF and  I find that in shoes with good arch height, the support is either too soft or too hard, if that makes any sense. The arches in these are prominent, yet a bit too hard; after a few hours of walking around I can tell I'll need to take a break. The heel is well supported. I'm a 7.5 and find that they fit well with some room to wiggle- wearing thicker socks will make them more snug. 7 would probably fit closer but allow for less winter sock width.

regarding sizing:  i have a slightly wide forefoot and slightly narrow heel.  based partly on past experience, i had assumed i might have problems with slip-ons because they lack the ability that laces provide to be cinched up at the top to draw tight around the back of the shoe and hold the heel in place and to provide adjustability so the toe box and arch is not too tight for me.  i tried the standard width and they work great for me.",fit my feet great and are very comfortable,1487030400,

The upper has begun separating from the rubber at the toe of the shoe, allowing water to easily get in. It has become so bad that water wets my socks from a walk through a field with morning dew. When I received these, I noticed that there was only a small amount of glue that appeared to hold the rubber outsole to the upper at the toes and it looked pretty precarious. But, I figured that these were Merrell's and they would hold up. I expect more from Merrell and I expect more from an $80 shoe. They are still comfortable, but I am now pretty much restricted to using them indoors only. Based on the other reviews being overwhelmingly positive, I think this defect may be limited to the camo version.

Otherwise, this is a nice shoe:

Unlike neoprene versions (e.g., Bogs), these slippers are extremely breathable. They keep your feet comfortably warm in the cold (even in single digits), but they don't sweat. To me, there is no worse feeling than your feet shedding sweat nonstop because they can't breathe in your shoes. I will gladly trade the lack of complete waterproof-ness for breatheability. This breatheability also means that these are fine to wear in the summer, whereas those made from neoprene will be unbearably hot.

These come in half-sizes. Many similar outdoor slippers do not, which can be a big deal if you wear a half-size. I am an 11.5, not a 12. I walk out of 12s and 11s scrunch my toes. Merrell is smart enough to realize that skipping out on half-sizes will make many people unable to wear these.

These slippers are extremely comfortable and easy to slip in and out of. You can feel the cushioning as you walk -- it is firm, but cushioned -- exactly what I want in an outdoor slipper.

I last bought this exact ""model number"" of shoe about 5 years ago (I bought 2 pairs at that time because they were on sale, and when the first of those 2 pairs finally fell apart about 2 years ago, I broke out the 2nd pair from the back of the closet, and I have been wearing that pair since then, and they are due to be replaced now).

I noticed that there was a 25% off sale on shoes at Amazon a few days ago, and decided to get a new pair of these.

Because several recent reviewers had noted that the sizing on these had changed and the fit for their particular size is now looser and longer (...at least one person said their size was a full inch longer than before) than it had been in the past, so that I could be sure that I got a pair that fit me, I ordered 3 pairs of these shoes -- one in the size I bought 5 years ago, one a half-size down from that, and one a half-size down from that.  I was thinking that if the length on these had been altered by a full inch, I'd probably need to go an entire size down from my normal size.

However, when I received the 3 pairs of shoes in the mail, I tried on my ""usual"" size first, and it fit exactly the same as the ones from 5 years ago.  I compared the old ones with the new ones side-to-side and sole-to-sole, and, if anything, the shoes I got yesterday are a smidgen shorter than the shoes I got 5 years ago (with the same size written on their inside labels).  Out of curiosity, I next tried on the half-size down of the new shoes, and it was definitely a half-size smaller (and therefore it was also ""true to size""), so I kept the new pair in my usual size and returned the 2 smaller pairs to Amazon.

Once again, I really appreciate Amazon's policy of free returns on shoes (which they sell directly), which gives one peace of mind in ordering shoes online, sight-unseen.

----
I thought I'd note that this new pair of shoes has a pungent ""chemical"" odor that I don't recall my past K-Swiss pairs having.  It was so strong that I actually had to put the shoes out on the porch to air out (they are still there).  I expect this is typical for most inexpensive leather shoes these days, and has to do with the way they put them together in modern manufacturing (the chemicals that they use to create the kind-of-real leather material, the glue, the 'rubber', etc.)  This also was the case with the 'leather' cell phone case that I bought recently, and other items.

The size is listed as an Adult Standard Size, I'm assuming it's measured against the average height for an American male standing at 5' 10.2"" because I am 6'2"" and it's a pretty snug fit. Tad uncomfortable but suitable for what I need it for. It leaves about 4 inches of bare skin from my ankles to the bottom of the pant legs.
I bought two one for myself and another for a friend who is about 5'11 and it fits him perfectly. The costume tag says to hand wash and flat dry, but I machine washed it on cold and hung it up to dry without any noticeable damage or abrasion to the fabric. Successfully got alcohol stains and mix drink stains out of the whitest parts on the costume.

As for the mask: The ears have two frame wires running along the entire length so their position and angle are adjustable. Inside the mask you have two more framing wires that help give the mast some rigidity and structure. There is a longer velcro strip on the back, making it easy to take the mask on and off. For the eyes you have black wire mesh that measures about 4 inches, and if you get the mask on perfectly they give you a pretty good field of view vertically but not so much horizontally because of how the mask fits on your head. The mask fabric is a tougher fabric and the tag says it is machine washable and dryer safe (washed twice already, no problems seen and successfully got lipstick marks off the white cheek fabric). The whiskers on the mask are black pipe cleaner wires with fabric on them. Don't look the best up close but their angles are also easily adjustable and from a distance they look great.

I prefer the Hi-tops over the lower style because the longer laces can be finely adjusted to a snug fit without any pinching at the instep. There's also no chaffing at the back of the heel as can sometimes happen with low sneakers. Compared to cushioned running shoes the canvas keeps my feet cooler and I feel that the flat soles are better for my feet.

The sizing codes are a frequent source of confusion - they refer to the width only. Here's a quick guide: Narrow width is labeled as AA for women and C for men; Medium width is labeled as B for women and D for men; Wide shoes are labeled C or D for women and E for men; Extra wide is labeled E for women and EE for men. So, the medium with is most common, and they are often listed as B(M) for women and D(M) for men - in both cases the M stands for medium width. If you see UK after the size then it's using the British width system, where the scale is C, D, E, F, G, H, with F bring the medium. Regarding whether it's a women's size or men's the product info should state women's or men's (to avoid confusion with the width designations F or M). You can convert between US women's and men's sizes using the size chart link under the size. All of the UK sizes on Amazon are for UK men (same as US men in most cases) use the size chart if you want to see the equivalent size for US women. Still with me?!

You can now recycle your old Chuck's at many Nike stores. The rubber will end up in tracks and playgrounds and the canvas in courts. Tip: their online store locator doesn't seem to be accurate in terms of listing stores with drop-off locations. I called a SF store that didn't have a recycling drop-off according to the website and it turned out that they actually did. So just call your local Nike store!

There's a lot of evidence now that being closer to barefoot (minimal cushioning and little or no elevation at the heel) is much better for your feet. For example, research shows that when running in highly-cushioned modern running shoes, people are more likely to come down on their heels, and that these heel-strikes can be very high-impact (Lieberman, Nature 2010). Converse (along with Tom's, Vibram, etc.) fit the bill for a close-to-barefoot shoe experience that will help keep your feet in shape. I once had an injury and was advised to wear arch-supporting insoles (which I wore in my Converse), but after recovery I took out the insoles (and only occasionally wear trainers with cushioned insoles) since the ""arch-support"" can lead to muscle atrophy and, ironically, loss of arches.

Perhaps it's sad that Nike bought Converse in 2003 and moved production overseas (Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Thailand, and other locations) since Nike has a dark past when it comes to conditions in overseas factories. They are clearly working on this since the boycotts and outrage in the 90's, but the situation is still not perfect. As of 2011, two-thirds of the 168 factories failed to meet Nike's own standards for contract manufacturing (for example, there were reports of kicking, slapping, verbal abuse, and cruel work environments).  I think they are trying to be more transparent about worker conditions since they've been under the spotlight more than some of their competitors (like Adidas). However, this clearly needs to change, and quickly.

In terms of materials, the canvas and synthetic rubber composition puts Converse above average in terms of sustainability. There is room for improvement of course. For example, Veja shoes (ranked higher on Rankabrand), have better worker conditions and are more eco-friendly; they're made using organic canvas and natural rubber that's sustainably harvested in the Chico Mendes reserve in the Amazon. I plan to try them out; they're available through an Amazon company called Great Dane. Meanwhile, I love Converse as a product and hope that Nike will sort out their factory conditions situation. Nike (in 2011) claimed that they work working on it but that there was little that they could do to stop it. Let's get this straight, Nike: You buy the Converse company, shift production oversees where workers are abused and paid barely enough for food and lodging (less than $0.50 per hour), while maintaining the same price for the shoes to the consumer, and yet claim that you can't do anything about the conditions?  They are under contract to you - I'm pretty sure you can do something.

So, overall I'll give it 5 stars gold stars for quality of the product and 4 ""green"" stars based on the social-ethical-environmental aspects of producing it. Converse was a great company but under Nike it loses a green star for poor working conditions in overseas factories. To put it into perspective (why do they only lose one star for bad conditions in some factories?), Nike are not as bad as some of the other big shoe companies, judging from available information. It looks like they are being transparent about the situation and their attempts to improve it (training managers, inspecting facilities, and revising subcontracts). Back in 2005 it became the first major apparel company to disclose factory locations and with that came some ugly stories about worker treatment, but perhaps not as ugly as the stories leaking out of more secretive companies like Adidas or Skechers. The materials used to make Chuck's together with recycling efforts from Nike warrants a 4 star rating, to be revised based on updates on worker conditions.",I've been wearing Chucks for over 20 years!

It's a very true translation of the show.  All the sets and characters in the show were also in the game.  Kudos there.

My four year has mastered all the character moves, the 3d environment, and some of the boss levels.  So the game begins relatively easy.  But the difficulty ramps up very quickly.  By the latter levels, Spongebob et al needs to find their way through mobius like mazes, difficult multi-step rewards, and a whole lotta nothing.  Progress became very frustrating and tedious around the 70% mark.

One thing to note, this costume does NOT come with any built in muscle. I absolutely didn't expect it to based on the price point. I actually think it's kind of nice without it, as the costume doesn't get as hot when he's running around and playing.

We had our church's Harvest Festival on October 30th and the thing was bothering him so much. The cape is held together by velcro, but the tabs go out from the edge of the cape, so the harder material of the velcro irritated his neck. Then I realized that the straps that keep the ""boots"" in place are also velcro and not one solid piece. They kept separating as he walked so we gave up. When he took off the costume, the velcro came off in 3 places on those boot ""straps"" The front tip of one of the feet looked like someone had snipped it with scissors because there was a piece of foam showing.

Today (October 31st) we went to a trunk or treat event and he wore the costume again. I had to physically sew the boot straps together so that they would stay in place. My son is not hard on his clothes and doesn't play rough at all due to low muscle tone, but just bending down to put on shoes caused him to get a hole in the knee. He also saw little holes that showed up in the arms. This costume was really a piece of junk and a total waste of my money.

Recently ordered five, K87s in Ash, order shipped from Dungarees. Net. All five were identical, all manufactured in Haiti, and all of them are total CRAP.

I have a long history with these shirts (I've been buying and wearing them for fifteen years) so I know what to expect in terms of fabric weight and fit. These shirts fail in both areas. In fact, they are so far off the mark I'm concerned they may actually be a counterfeit product. I have no way of knowing for sure of course, and I don't make that claim lightly, but there can only be two reasons for the discrepancy in quality: either A) they are actually counterfeit, or B) Carhartt has lot their minds and has allowed a once superior product to degrade to the point where it now ranks well below a $6 Fruit of the Loom t-shirt from Walmart.

Here's what you can expect from current version of these shirts: the fabric is now thin and rough feeling--there is no ""drape"" to the fabric any longer. After washing, the seams, especially around the collar, are drawn and puckered. The fit can only be described as ""bag-like"" with the most noticeable flaw being the length of the sleeve. The underarm seam is too short, causing the fabric bunch-up in the arm pit area, as others have complained about. And, coming back to the fabric again, the shoulder-to-sleeve seam now pokes up (instead of laying down) making it look like you're wearing shoulder pads (not as flattering as you might think).

My advice is to pass. Until Carhartt address the quality problem, or the counterfeit problem, I'm no longer a customer. One point I will agree with is that buying these shirts from a brick and mortar store may yield better results. if you've ever owned the genuine article, you'll recognize one of these turkeys the moment you pull one over your head in the dressing room.

I've gone through multiple packs and armbands for phones, gels, etc.  My previous Fuel Belt and SPi Belts were ok but not spectacular.

When I gave up on iPhones a week ago, I opted for a much larger Samsung Galaxy S4 Active and topped it off with an Otterbox case.  I immediately realized NONE of my belts/packs were going to hold the phone.  Out of desperation, I ran over to Dick's Sporting Goods to see what was available.  I couldn't believe my luck when they had the Nathan 5k and another belt, by Nike, that also fit my phone.  The Nathan was the clear winner, though, because it had a wider, softer material for it's belt and it also was stretchier.

I have not regretted my decision!  Despite having a giant hunk of a phone, I can't even feel this thing when I wear it.  And it doesn't rub in the slightest.  They only way I know it's there is I occasionally hear the zippers jingling a little.  It easily holds my phone, house key, and gels.

I did say there was a flaw.  It's minor but it's a real head scratcher. They belt includes enough material strap this belt to Andre the Giant's larger brother!  And there's no loop to hold it.  Unlike many other belts, the belt part itself doesn't loop back on itself, adjusted by buckles.  Instead, it just cinches like an ordinary belt.  I've got a 34 waist and there's probably at least a foot of excess belt strap.  But I've tucked it in for the relatively short runs I've run so far and used a rubber band on a longer one.  I'll cut it eventually but hadn't b/c I wanted to make sure I wasn't missing a piece.  Other reviews echo my concern, so I guess not.

The waist pack does it's just. However, make sure you tighten it so it is pretty snug, otherwise it will bounce and ride up.

One problem I've noticed when using this pack in hot, humid weather is that my phone sometimes overheats. So long as you're not running in 90 degree weather, or maybe if your phone is a bit better than mine, it shouldn't end up being an issue.

I like Wrangler jeans and find that the relaxed fit jeans fit me pretty comfortably.  I have a stack of them at home, all having been acquired from local brick and mortar retailers (with the exception of the pair I'm now writing this review for, and another pair that were dark black, ordered at the same time I ordered the pair that I'm reviewing here).  The jeans that I was already using have a different weight and thicker feel compared to the jeans that I received as fulfillment of my orders.  The ones that I received feel soft and are comfortable to me, but they also feel like they are lighter weight and as such likely won't be as durable as the jeans that I already had were.

Oddly enough I purchased the jeans that I'm reviewing here from the A to Z store because the stores that I had previously purchased my jeans from have a reputation of squeezing every penny out of the cost of their products before they put them on sale and as such I had an expectation that was leading to a shorter life span for my jeans.  Realistically, I can't complain about the life span of those jeans as they have held up well (most are in the 2+ year range, if not a little more), though they do eventually wear to the point of having holes in them, or having belt loops that are breaking away.

Sadly, given my disappointment with the jeans I received here, I am now back to avoiding doing any internet ordering of my jeans, instead I'll have to visit the local stores and find my supplies there.

The reason I removed one star is that if you are in any way interested in a little fashion you are unlikely to like these. They are very much a cowboy no-nonsense sort of fit.

The same is true for some of the other brands as well. Poor denim quality throughout the industry.

These Wranglers seem OK. The waist is about an inch or inch and one-half higher than on Levis so they feel a bit like wearing  trousers instead of jeans. The front pockets are cut too shallow and tend to pull out when removing keys or whatever. Even though they are listed as relaxed fit, they are snug in the thigh area just above the knee compared to a Levis relaxed fit. The inseam length is OK, but the waist is maybe a half-inch too small. I think this is because they ride above where I normally wear my jeans, so the measurement is a little off. You might want to keep that in mind when ordering (use a trousers waist size and not a jeans waist size).But they fit OK since I'm in-between sizes anyway, but I'm not sure how much they will shrink. I'll probably wash them in cold water for now.

UPDATE: After 2 cold water washes, every hem on the front and back pockets of the Wrangler jeans has rolled over and will not roll back.

I normally wear a size 34DD bra so that is what I ordered here.
The 34DD fits me perfectly.

ADVICE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE ISSUES WITH FITTING:
I used to work in lingerie and know that about 80% of women wear their bras in the wrong size. If you feel like you fluctuate in sizes you really dont, you are just wearing the wrong size! I suggest that you go to your local department store and have a lady trained in lingerie just measure you so that you know and you beat the issue. Some brands run a bit different but in that case its the brand, not your measurements. I wear a solid 34DD but can wear a 36D (in some bras) or a 32DDD (in some bras) However the only bras that work for me are my correct size. Take the guess work out if you plan to order online.

-The fit is tight like it is supposed to be. It flattens and smooths my stomach and gives me that perfect hour glass shape I wanted and needed.
- It is sexy and stylish with removable garters I will tack on later and hook up to some thigh highs when I take my wedding dress off... it is hot enough that I can wear it like lingerie. form, function, and sexy- cant beat it!
-the back is low which is nice for dresses that plunge.. fits under my dress discreetly
-good support and I know Im not going to pop out

The things I didn't like were the price, which is a bit steep I believe but I won't dock it because I could have opted for  something cheaper and more crappily made! I have no regrets!
The other thing is I wish that the front came down just a bit farther. I have a short torso but still found that I wanted it a tad longer so I wasn't worried about any stomach getting smashed out the bottom.

I am 5'6"" and weigh 140lbs 34DD bra.

There are also two settings for hooks and mine was attached on the looser of the two (I am hoping that by my wedding in 5 months I can cinch it to the tighter clasps- fingers crossed!) I was really worried that it wasn't going to be as tight as I wanted but it truly does the trick!

These are really well made, bullet proof bags that will keep all your stuff dry unless you submerge the entire bag in water.

These bags don't have a stiff shape, so you can load them with tons of stuff. The seams are all completely watertight, and the only way water can get in is through the top zipper, which is protected by a large Velcro flap that covers the zipper, so even in driving rain, it stays dry inside. I have looked out the window of an airplane and seen my bag sitting in the rain on the tarmac, and I know my clothes will be dry when I get to the luggage carousel.

There are no dividers, no pockets, no key loops of other gadgets inside; just a giant canyon of dry storage. The bottom isn't stiff either, so when you lift from the supplied shoulder strap, the bag will tend to fold or bend a little in the middle. I usually carry the bag with the handles so it's not an issue. I have loaded it with over 50# of stuff without a problem. It will carry heavy clothes, boots, camping gear etc.

These are more attractive than my old oxblood Topsider loafers. The multiple earth tones go well with my pairs of tan and khaki shorts.

Broken in, the shoes are comfortable enough to wear all day. In fact, I have to remind myself that they are for a purpose, and I probably shouldn't wear them all over the place, lest they wear out before my next sailing assignment.

A note on the colors. The color I ordered was salt and pepper grey but really it's a much more brown tinted grey color but not as dark as the bison brown color. I would recommend these Newport models over the Newport H2 because those aren't leather and seem to fall apart much faster than they should given the fact  they aren't giving them away very cheaply.

 I also like these because they could be worn with pants at a semi formal type gathering they being leather they go nice with many different styles. Also these are pretty warm and could be worn during the Fall into early winter but that all depends on your geographic location in the world obviously I wouldn't recommend this to people in the upper northern latitudes but I'm in western NC where we have more mild winters so ultimately it's up to your tolerance for cold.

I'm a college student, specifically a commuter, so I go from indoors to outdoors very often. I usually rush from building to building to secure a front seat in lecture halls - possibly grab a snack on the way too. At the moment it's too cold for my bare face, even if I'm just walking.

The Turtle Fur Neck Warmer:

The bad:
One wash in and it started ""pilling,"" I've provided a photo to show the extent just after a couple of washes. On top of this it seems to have gotten a little loose since I've first gotten it, hopefully this doesn't persist. It still stays in place now but it may become difficult. Something to keep in mind is that it isn't wind-proof. I never expected it to be but hope to prevent the shattered expectation of another consumer post-transaction.

The good:
All I have to do is pull it over my head before putting on my hat, adjust it a bit, and I'm done. I used to use a scarf for my face like other students but this is so much easier. It does a decent job of covering my face and keeping it warm; I'm not concerned about my neck since my jackets cover my neck already. I'm sure it'd cover my neck and keep it warm just as well.

The verdict:
This thing is super convenient! You don't have to worry about it falling off. I've had mine for about a month and am going to buy another for a relative. It's not of the finest quality, but I only paid $11 so I'm not complaining. It definitely gets the job done.",Much more convenient than a scarf.,1424476800,

I got a great deal, but now that I've worn the thermals I wouldn't pay more than that. Why? Because these are very basic, very thin (think pantyhose) and Made in China.

I'm 5'1"", 112 lbs. and straight-bodied except for my 32F chest.  I'm usually an XS, but due to the sale price I ordered Small. It fits like lounge wear (not like a snug thermal), but I don't mind. Sometimes I come home, remove my work clothes and lounge around in these. The pant length is long on me, but miraculously everything adjusts!

For thermal underwear, this is quite light and insufficient for extreme cold weather. I use it for winter sports (mountain trekking, skiing) with multiple layers over it. A typical trekking outfit for me would be silk thermals, cotton turtleneck, merino neck gaitor, down sweater, then heavy winter coat with insulated ski gloves. For all that bulk these thermals are quite breathable.

Be careful with sharp edges on the thin, delicate cloth, for e.g. fingernails and jewelry. Like pantyhose it can snag, but I haven't has any holes (yet).

I wash and dry these in a separate lingerie bag without issue. Treat these garments delicately and they should last long.

Silk. Neither the highest quality silk, nor the lowest. Not slick like the silk shirts from the '80s. Slight diamond pattern.

Due to the ankle and a recurring dislocating hip that occasionally makes one leg slightly longer than the other, I have temporarily lost my natural gait.
I wanted shoes that were lightweight, and still offered some support and did not lift my feet 1.5 inches from the ground or force them into odd positions (toes significantly lower than heels).
Saucony meets my demands.

I wear mine to for daily activities and work (not much running yet). I also wear them for physical therapy and around the house for support and balance, something I never used to do. I love being barefoot and tended to resent shoes before I started wearing barefoot running shoes (and now Sauconys). But I never wore my Lems/Stems around the house 'just because'. I wear any of my 3 pairs of Sauconys in my house daily and I plan to buy more pairs. When I'm able, I will probably buy Lems again but do not plan to ever give up my Sauconys.

The Jazz Low Pro offers:
Low to the ground cushioning and support.
True to size fit.
Good sized toe box for natural feel.
A stay put fit without being too constricting.
Immediate comfort that is easy to slide into.
No need to break in.
Caused no foot, leg or back pain in a customer who is already susceptible.
Lightweight feel from toe to heel and sole to tongue.

My only disappointment is with the vegan version of the sneaker. I bought vegan only because it was a cheaper pair and I wanted black for my return to work.

The toe box seems slightly narrower than the suede/nylon version. This does not affect comfort for me, only visual appeal as the toe end looks slightly narrower than the center of the shoe.
The vegan version is just slightly stiffer but I anticipate no problems letting the canvas soften up a little more as I wear them.
The feel is not as smooth and soft -- easier to remember that you're wearing shoes (which I don't like).

Other than minor differences (not necessarily bad ones) in appearance and stiffness, the vegan version is comparable to the suede. However, next time I will pay a little more for the suede.

Still a great shoe and I wear them often.

(Although, I do love to watch the TV show Eureka!) I was happy that they were vegan, as well.

I went to four different B&M stores, tried on dozens of pairs of shoes and was beginning to think that my feet had suddenly grown in some weird fashion (no pun intended), as NONE of them fit properly. I tried on various sizes, from various brands, in various styles and nothing was right. It was soooo frustrating!

I ordered these in what I previously thought to be ""my size"" (women's 10), based on others' reviews and whew, was I happy when they arrived and fit PERFECTLY!

I wore them around the house for a bit to make sure, then to work for a full day of light duty stuff, yesterday to the gym for some precor and rowing machine work, and then, today, to the gym for a lo-impact workout. So far, so good! They are SOOOO comfortable AND - BONUS: they make my feet look smaller! This was confirmed by my mom, when she exclaimed this upon seeing them for the first time.

Fit points (in all shoes) that matter to me:
- toe room: these have a good amount of it, so toes can wiggle, but not so much that the foot is unstable or the toe box looks huge.
- stitching in toe area: At first, I thought the bar of stitching that runs across the top of my foot, at the base of my toes, would irritate me, but I only noticed it the first hour or so and haven't noticed it since.
- the area around the Achilles tendon: again, just the right amount of room (shoes usually bend forward too much for me, not these)
- arch: i dunno if i have flat feet or not, but I do love a nice hefty arch. These have a good one, with a smooth transition from the rest of the surface.
- sole width: some shoes seem narrower in the sole, even though the shoe might fit, thus causing my foot to look like it's floating or hanging over the edge - ick! These are just right in sole width.

PROS:
- sized right (for me, anyway!)
- comfy!
- nice style (simple, but not boring; old-skool, but not out of style)
- vegan! Saucony's site claims: ""This Vegan friendly Saucony shoe contains no animal products, by-products or derivatives. Canvas and hemp create the classic design.""
- TWO pairs of shoestrings (mine came wearing a black pair, and with an oatmeal pair in the box) - this helps to match your style & I find I get more use from an old pair of kicks, when I spruce them up with some new laces!
- women's sizes 5-12, with half-sizes from 5.5 to 9.5
- the insole is removable!
- so many great colors!!!

CONS:
- the frayed cotton look on the oatmeal parts does make it look a little scraggly. (as mentioned by another reviewer) but it's not totally noticeable and, some may even think it gives the shoe a bit of ""granola"" charm. Mine seem a bit more frayed than the pic shows. I'm on the fence and could take it or leave it. We'll see in the coming months, if it deteriorates faster than expected. [2017-Dec UPDATE: fraying is minimal and a snip here or there cleans it right up. I may have done this once. I wear them (to work out) about 4+ hours per week. They still look great and are still comfy and I'm still very pleased with my purchase!]

NOTE:
there is a good bit of chunky traction on this shoe. This will certainly help on the trail, but causes a noticeable amount of grip on smooth floors. I find it tolerable (even a bit soothing, as pressure on the various tread triangles gives my foot a bit of a ""massage"" while I move around), and the added grippiness is a minor concern for me, compared to my other preferences, but if this is an area of major concern for you, you might be bothered by it. This might decrease, as the tread wears a bit. If I notice, I'll update.

CONCLUSION:
Active vegans have another reason to rejoice! And, so do active non-vegans, or non-active vegans! These shoes are super-cute, cool, comfy, and caring to animals, and indirectly, the planet! They fit great (true-to-size) and can be worn confidently! With so many great colors and the guarantee of a good fit and function, I will be back to buy more! Thanks, Amazon!

The original Jazz eventually morphed into a cheapy senior-look leisure shoe...the indignity!  Why was that ever allowed to happen? I should have bought two dozen pairs way-back-when when I found that I liked the fit, comfort, stability and durability of the Jazz and later Jazz Grid.

I fast-walk 4 miles daily M-F on a university track and have been doing so since the early '80s so I know which shoe of those I've tried over the years delivers what I want/need in a running shoe. After the demise of the Jazz-as-I-knew-it and years of pinched toes/blackened toe nails, quickly worn-out outsoles from Adidas et al, it took me awhile to rediscovered the curved last, generous toe area and narrow heel area of the Jazz in the Hurricane 11 Progrid running shoe. Fit and comfort at last. Should buy a dozen before these morph...

Not crazy about the look though--that segmented bulbous heel...Not attractive. And the over-the-top visual busyness of the shoe top. How about a more minimalist, stream-lined look?

I have two jewelry boxes and a wall unit of earrings. But I still have more. Maybe I need to stop buying jewelry.

Anyway, I had tried putting earrings that I didn't wear often in a craft sorter but then I wore them even less. Well, never actually.

So I wanted something that would keep them organized but easy to access. I searched through hundreds of pages on Amazon as well as Pintrest (there are some fun ways to organize but nothing for jewelry hoarders like me). This was my choice and so far I'm very happy.

Make no mistake. This is not a small organizer. It is large and may not fit into many drawers so measure first if you want to tuck it away. The compartments are flocked (lined with a soft, velvety fuzz) and come in a variety of sizes. I have room for hanging earrings, short earrings and multiple earring pairs in each spot. There is also room for average (not thick bands) rings in the middle.

The 'cover' is really just a thick acetate that is cut to sit on top. Not really a cover in my book but enough to keep dust out and allow for quick access.","Nice, Large Compartments",1399939200,

The trays stack nicely and can fit in a drawer or sit on the dresser.  They aren't decorative or pretty like a wooden jewelry box, but neither are they an eyesore. The ""box"" or case is hard clear plastic.  It is very sturdy, but I wouldn't advise dropping it on a tile floor. The cover, which is really only needed for the top one since all the others have another tray on top (if you buy more than one as I did) is very lightweight.  It is simply a totally flat piece of very lightweight clear plastic than can be bent almost in half without breaking.  But it keeps out dust, which is its intended purpose.  The compartments are several different sizes and shapes to accommodate different size earrings.  The longest compartments are about 2 5/8"" long x 1-1/4 wide at the short end and 1-1/2 wide at the long end.  Great for large tear drop shaped earrings or ovals.  Other compartments are 2"" x 1-1/2""; 1-1/2"" x 1-3/8""; 1-7/8 x 1-1/2.  My round hoop earrings which are 1-1/2"" across fit in one of the largest square compartments.  Hoops much bigger would not fit in this tray.  You can get other trays in this series that have larger compartments to hold bracelets and such.  I can easily fit a couple pairs of earrings in one compartment, and none of my earrings are little tiny studs.

Also, if you have a LOT of jewelry, as I do, it can be a nuisance to lift one container after another after another to find what you want.

Plusses: large face is easy to read.  IndiGlo!!  Time and Date...that's it.

Minus: Big face means that if you wear your watch down low on your wrist, distal to the ulnar styloid, the crown hits your wrist with any degree of wrist dorsiflexion (bending the hand back toward the watch).  This gets to be irritating and will limit the time on my wrist.  I'm not a big watch wearer anyway, and so any irritating factors will reduce the time on my wrist.

If you wear your watches loosely, allowing the watch to slide up your arm, over the styloid, then you'll find it more comfortable, but then you'll also be dealing with ""roll"", where the watch face rotates around your forearm because the strap is too loose.

1. this watch fits perfectly nice on my wrist, i'm not a kid by any means i'm a 6 foot 3 230lb man who has a pretty thick wrist. It feels perfectly comfortable on my wrist, it feels like its barely there but keeps its place on my wrist and it's not even close to being fully stretched out but its also not loose.
2. The instructions, you mean what instructions? the one it comes with is just it saying its water resistant in like 7 different languages, to get the ACTUAL instructions in how to set this you have to go online. That being said I did NOT have as much trouble as some people in the reviews did, I set the time day and date within under a minute of setting it up. I however have not set the alarm yet as i'm debating whether I even need to.
3. The quality, it feels like a very solid product I don't feel like its a cheap dimestore watch it feels like one of those deals you find in a store where you get the feeling you're getting your moneys worth for what you're paying for, this is a solid watch.
4. Check your battery, keep an eye on how good the timekeeping is, I suspect alot of people have gotten faulty batteries which does happen in such a mass produced watch but its really no fault on the product itself.
5. Awesome for winter, I keep very bulky watches (like my casio rangeman which is a 175 dollar watch) but in winter time, especially going into the city you don't want a bulky watch that makes having sweaters and gloves and getting things out of your pocket difficult, this easily slips under my gloves, sweater and doesn't obstruct me getting things from my pocket, its very streamlined. I love that.

Overall I think this is a great watch. It reminds me alot of what my Grandfather wore and I think that is what it was aiming for, your grandpa's old expandable band timekeeper, It wasn't the most beautiful thing on the planet but it got the job done and kept on ticking.

small update: its accurately keeping time, on the dot and its been a few days now.

2nd update: its been a month now still as accurate as the day I set it.

3rd update: its now may 10th and its still keeping time and hasn't missed a beat, still on the same minute as every other accurate watch.

I didn't even know her old one had a light, but lo and behold it does, the bright green indiglo kind. Sadly, this model does not. I can't with good conscious rate any lower than 5 stars, because my gosh do these watches hold up, and there was nothing misleading in the description. It's Timex's prerogative to decide it's not worth it to put lights in kids watches anymore.

I've ordered a new watch band, and may try treating the inside of the band with something that doesn't absorb sweat (something with a wax to it?

I'm told that neatsfoot oil will deteriorate the stitches, so I'll probably go back to the baseball glove conditioner.

Dont ask me how it happened but it did. Im a dad of two, self-employed, always in some sort of situation or another, and no one has accused me of being organized. Its probably within twenty feet of me right now, but it could be on the other side of the world for all I know. At any rate, it wasn't on my wrist anymore and I felt naked. Sure, Ive got a phone, but I grew up with a watch, spent a lot of time learning to tell time when I was five or six, and Im damn sure not letting that all go to waste. I had to find a decent substitute watch until mine turned up. Something affordable, something solid, something utilitarian yet pleasing to the eye. Something that could take a lickin and keep on tickin. Thats it! A Timex. My first watch was a seven dollar Timex I bought with my own money when I was six. I can still remember my dad taking me to the local drugstore after school. It was a yellow brass case Easy Reader with a black rubber strap. A mans watch, huge on my scrawny boy wrist, but I loved it and had it for many years until at some point it disappeared. See a recurring theme here?

So I began my search for a watch that wouldnt break the bank or, well, break. As I browsed, I came to this one  the Timex Easy Reader T20461. I immediately loved the look of it with its white face, Helvetica numbers, red 24-hour feature, silver-brass case, and stainless steel expander bracelet - which reminded me of the twist-o-flex watch bands my dad and grandfather always wore. The watch itself is akin to much more expensive railroad watches I had admired, but never considered buying. Without thinking twice I threw it into my cart, checked out and the man in brown brought it to my door within two days.

Upon opening the box I wasn't disappointed. It looked better than the photos, felt solid and was easy to set. Yeah, the day and date require a little extra effort, but if this ruins your week you probably shouldn't get out of bed. It was the first time I wore an expander watch band and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it didn't pinch my arm hair at all. Im no gorilla, but Im not in kindergarten anymore either. One thing did bother me, though. While I appreciated the band, the way it tapers just looked a little lady-like on my wrist. Or maybe it was my wrist making the watchband look lady-like. Who knows? It didn't bother me too much and I loved the watch, so thought nothing more of it. That is, until I happened upon a watchstrap rack at a large big box store that shall remain unnamed. Hanging there was collection of the old school twist-o-flex expander bracelets I remembered so fondly from my dad and granddad. I found one that matched the shine of the watch case (the original band is a bit dull by comparison), paid a whopping 7 bucks for it (solid stainless steel), took it home, removed a few links to fit my lady-like wrist (its not hard  you just need a decent pocket knife and a set of needle-nosed pliers or tweezers), slid it on my wrist and voila! The perfect watch for me. Easy on, easy off; tasteful styling; understated; doesnt scream look at me, I spend too much money on stuff because I feel inadequate! or Mug me! Im obviously fiscally irresponsible so relieve me of my money!

I hope I don't lose it, but if I doits easy to replace.  I wear it with pride and cant recommend it highly enough for men like me that need a practical, no-nonsense, solid, reliable, unpretentious timepiece. So far its been dropped several times, drooled on, had coffee spilled on it and I forgot to take it off when I jumped in the shower the other day. Still as good as new. Oh yeah, Indiglo cant be beat. You might have a Rolex, but your Rolex doesnt have Idiglo.

Sorry to say my other watch still hasn't turned up. If it does, Ill be happy to see it, give it a hug, then place it safely in my sock drawer until next time we meet.

UPDATE: Still taking a lickin' and keeps on tickin'. Has a few character marks now, but runs as well as the day I bought it. Doesn't seem to gain or lose a second. I rarely take it off so it experiences whatever I do. I have, however, traded in the stretchy band for a leather nato that I snagged off another Timex (see pic).",It Is What It Is,1425600000

A number of reviewers have indicated how loud the tick is with Timex watches.  Perhaps it's an advantage of getting older, but-what tick?  (LOL)  The band is pretty nice-it becomes more flexible as you wear it.  It fit me using the middle of nine holes.  The ""Indiglo"" is definitely nice feature especially if you wear your watch to bed and like checking the time in the middle of the night.  This replaces a fifteen year old LL Bean watch, for which I got a refund since they couldn't replace the crystal and the current versions are huge.  The only reason I gave it four stars and not five is I'd like to see how long it lasts.  Does it truly ""Take a lickin and keep on tickin?""  If I get two or three years out of it I'll be happy since it comes with only a one year warranty.  Timex has an extended five year warranty so I called them and got it for $5-probably good insurance.

It's still going strong-July 2014. Haven't had to change battery yet.  The crystal does scratch but then I wear it all the time -rarely take it off.  After a couple years if it's still working I'll break down and get the crystal replaced.  I'll send it back to Timex in Little Rock for this.

I'm amazed how big new watches have become.  I really like this smaller (traditional?) size.

Update August 2014-the battery died.  The back comes off by prying it-which was a little tricky.  I bought replacement batteries (5) through Amazon and it is working again.  I left the back off, but covered, while waiting for the batteries.  Probably not a good idea since it was rather humid and it fogged up when I wore it.  So, I took the back off again and put it under a lamp for the night.  This seems to have cured the problem.  So, I got a year and a few months on the first battery.

FYI-As I took the stainless steel back off I noticed that the non stainless steel part around the back was pitted.  I assume this is from sweat and could become problematic in a few years.  I imagine the body of more expensive watches are stainless steel to prevent this type of corrosion.

August of 2016-I've probably replaced the watchband four or five times by now.  Walmart has a good selection for around $10-12.  The watch continues to keep good time.  The battery I put in two years ago is still going strong.  The watch is showing wear around the crystal where it meets the metal.  I continue to wear it although I received  another Timex, as a gift, which  is larger.  I think I've gotten my money out of it and the extra five year warranty I bought for $5  may not pay off.  I upgraded to five stars from four-I think it earned it.

The back of the watch, not the disk covering the battery, continues to degrade from sweat.  I would definitely go the stainless steel route in the future.",What tick??,1364428800,

I just tried to measure my wrist (not so easy!) and it looks like it measures about six inches--measured the watch, too, and it seems to be about seven inches (band and watch combined). I haven't had any trouble with it pinching, etc, but it does seem to me that it would be snug on a lot of people. (I think there's a larger version but you have to read the specs carefully to determine which one it is). I know some people complained about the band pinching--I think that's inherent with any expansion band. All in all, I'd say it's a graceful looking woman's watch.

***UPDATE
So far I've been wearing this watch alot and so far there has only been one problem. As others have stated the leather strap seems to separate from normal wear. The problem is that the strap, while feeding into the buckle will rub up against it and case the adhesive holding the black leather onto the tan underside will fail and the layers begin to separate. I'll post a picture of this so you can get an idea what I'm talking about. This isn't a deal breaker because you can always swap the strap out for a NATO or another brand of leather strap. On the plus side though the strap is very comfortable and wears really nicely. It's not stiff and lays on the wrist unlike other bands that are a pain to wear and is keeping pretty soft too. It keeps time well as should be expected from a quartz watch, and the indiglo is a nice feature to have. I will be purchasing a couple more of these to keep for myself incase this watch gets discontinued or my others break. It does exactly what it's supposed to do and besides the slight variance in dial color and the strap issue its a great watch that I'd recommend to others.

The current trend toward mounting a clock on your arm and calling it a watch seems silly to me and I don't think the fad will last. After all, a fad last a season, a classic last forever!

Even though I have a lot of watches I don't wear most of them. When I needed an everyday work watch I went looking to an old standby, Timex. I found this particular model (T40091) appealing because it mixes a simple classic style with some modern conveniences such as a very reliable quartz movement and the ingeneous indiglo light feature. The watch is the perfect size for a full grown man and is made of brushed stainless steel, like a serious watch should be. Upon very close inspection I could find no flaws in the case, the machining was simply perfect.

The glass fit perfectly and is flush with the bezel. I wish it had been slightly recessed but its okay. I like how they put a slight raise in the case around the crown to act as a protective guard. The face of the watch is very simple and easy to read. I even like the slightly odd face color. It's somewhere between a dark olive drab and gray and in certain light it can appear black. It gives the watch an older look, as if its been around for twenty or thirty years. The hands are pretty standard and the luminous hands work but just barely. In a watch of this price range its fine and besides you have the indiglo feature so its really not needed. About the only thing I wish this watch had is a cyclops over the date. My eyes aren't what the used to be and seeing that little date is getting harder every year. This watch also has the hack feature so setting the time accurately is easy. I have a habit of checking it almost daily (a little OCD).

Things I wish Timex would change...add the cyclops over the date, remove the extra face writing to make it even simpler, make the secondary numerals just a tad larger, change the band.

The band is not bad but seems to come a little small. I have medium sized wrists for a man and it fits me on the second to last hole. I seems like they should have made it about a 1/2"" longer. I plan to replace the stock band with a NATO band so this isn't a big deal.

PROS
2. The design is pretty.
3. It glows in the dark.
4. It makes telling, and learning how to tell time, time easy.
5. It comes on and off pretty easy.
6. It is lightweight.

CONS
1. The band is not water resistant and so the watch has to be removed too often. (It usually gets a little when she washes her hands.) Then there is a long period of waiting for the band to dry out when she can't use the watch. The alternative is to remove the watch whenever there is a chance that it will get wet some how and that can be time consuming and runs the risk of her losing it if she places it somewhere at school, in a public bathroom etc...

I took it to a jeweler to have the battery changed. Two weeks later, that battery was dead. I returned to the jeweler, who said the battery was completely drained, that the second hand was not working, though the Indiglo function was. The jeweler said it was a problem with the movement, and to send it back for repair.

I sent my watch to Timex (it was still under the one year warranty) and Timex could not repair it. I was sent a new watch.

The second watch worked great...for less than a month. I contacted Timex again, and they sent me watch #3. I didn't have a chance to wear #3, since the band was so large. Yesterday, I started to resize the band, and noticed watch #3 is dead. No Indiglo, no movement, nothing.

I contacted Timex yet again, asking for a refund. Since I purchased the watch through Amazon, they will not refund my money, but they are sending watch #4.

I've never had a Timex watch perform so poorly, and I've worn Timex for years. My Timex sports watch is still fine, but this one seems like a dud. I've never been so frustrated with a Timex product.

Update: Watch #4 died completely 2 weeks after receiving it. I had to have links removed (another $10 expense) and wore it exactly 2 times (once to a lunch and once to a meeting, not hard use at all) for a total of 6 hours' wear before it was COMPLETELY dead. No Indiglo, no nothing.

I've had this watch for almost 2 years and it's been a great and dependable watch.

When I first saw it online, the watch looked huge.  I purchased it anyway because I wanted a second Timex watch to wear for work.  This is my other Timex watch (which I also love)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Timex-Women-s-Fashion-Two-Tone-Bracelet-T25771/dp/B00020J0SQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Timex Women's Fashion Two-Tone Bracelet #T25771</a>.

I was so happy when it arrived!  While it is much larger than most women's watches (it's advertised as a men's watch) it's a beautiful watch.  I love the colors of this watch; blue face with the silver band.

The large face makes it so easy for me to see what time it is.  I'm a little sneaky sometimes... If I'm in a meeting or speaking with someone and I need to know what time it is, I can very easily, just *slightly* tilt my hand towards me and without moving my face or eyes too much, I can see what time it is on this watch!  I don't want to be rude to whoever I am talking with, and this watch allows me to see what time it is with out being overly obvious that I am checking the time!  I know, it doesn't sound like a big deal, but I appreciate being able to do that.

I get so many compliments on my watch.  I've been asked why I am wearing a men's watch and I tell them it's super comfortable to wear and I love the color and the features of the watch.  Along with the time, the date is easy to read.  Also if I'm in a dark room, the indiglo light works great.  Because the watch face is blue, the indiglo light tends to glow a light blue color.  Once I show them how awesome the watch is, they want one too and they ask me where I got it!

One last thing, both the time and the date are so easy to set!  Just takes a few moments to do.

Easy to adjust the band size (Sometimes is a little tedious though) It looks sharp without the high price tag. Even though it doesn't look like it, pretty rugged, at least from my experience with this particular Timex line. Very easy to read the #'s on the face.

Now the negatives. If you flip the watch over and look at the back cover it says ""WR 30 M"". Well I have had water get into several of these watches, it was a very small amount though, just enough to fog up the watch. So just be careful to make sure you take it off before washing dishes, or a shower.

Secondly, changing the day and date is a pain in the rear to some degree. Once its set, no big deal. Basically, it would be nice if Time installed another knob on the watch. Right across from the current one. Dedicated specifically to the day and date.(This way it would look balanced?)

Would I recommend it? Yeah I would. For the price you get yourself quite a decent good looking rugged watch. It's easy to avoid the water. And like I said, once you get the day and date set, no problems there either.

Like all products it could be better.

UPDATE 2-08-11

This wonderful wrist watch had survived a lot up until now from when I bought it, scuffs, scrapes, bangs. The face had even gotten bubbles in it where I was using it while welding and it was still going strong... But one thing it couldn't survive, me trying to change the battery. I somehow screwed my watch over and knocked loose the second hand, or a gear when installing a replacement battery. *Was trying to reinstall the back plate on the watch*.. I consider myself pretty competent, but I do make mistakes... anyways, not sure what I did exactly, but I did it very well. Long story short, its been a great watch and I'll be ordering another one.

I had to take it to a jeweler who charged $16 to remove the links (I've since learned how to remove them myself!).  I'm really disappointed because the watch is everything I wanted in a watch otherwise.

Original review -

This watch is perfect for me.

When I lost my 8 year old watch on the train, there were features that I had to have on my new one and this watch has them all.

- The indiglo light is a must for me as I'm often in a dark room and need to know what time it is.  The light is just right without causing a disturbance for others.

- Once I started looking for a watch, the date feature became very attractive to me.  I use it all the time now and don't have to look at the calendar on my cell phone as often.

- The gold and silver look of the watch set things up for me so that I can wear any earrings, etc. and feel it all comes together.

The good thing is that it looks great.  It's a good watch for professionals who don't want multiple watches and want to be able to wear to any kind of function.  It does a good job of that. Plus it doesn't look too bulky, which to me was crucial because I have very small wrists.  However, my indiglo gave out on me last week after only having my watch for 6 weeks.  Luckily, Timex sent me a pre-paid box to send it back to the factory.  The warranty lasts for a year too.  The only problem I face now will be getting Timex to either take out the extra links or reimburse me for having to get someone else to do it for me.

I hesitated on buying it due to concerns about the strap size, and whether it would be too shiny, but I love how it looks. While the watch is more of a shiny gold than a matte gold, it isn't cheesy bright- I tried to take an accurate photo. Its definitely a slim feminine profile, so if you like a chunkier look maybe consider the men's version instead. The Indiglo and water resistance features are a big plus for me!

All that being said, be prepared to adjust the size of the band. IT ISN'T FUN, if you do it yourself. When I first took the watch out of the packaging, I thought, maybe that'll fit me. NOPE. I do have fairly small wrists but I took out 8 links (over an inch worth). And being cheap and too lazy to drive to the watch repair store, I decided to do it on my own following YouTube videos. Here's some tips if you decide to brave it: get as many tools handy as you can. Something like a 00 flathead screwdriver, small awl, some tweezers or fine needlenose pliers for jewelry. I had 2/3 of that and struggled a bit whereas I think tweezers or pliers would have helped. The process isn't that tricky but takes a bit of patience and precision; I was lacking in the patience department. So while I successfully did it, you can tell in one spot that I didn't quite get it right. Would anyone else be able to tell? No. Is it secure? Yes. Am I being annoyingly perfectionist after being lazy? Yes. My suggestion: unless you have small tools and are fairly handy, just take it to the watch shop!","Great watch, DYI band adjustment is not so great",1473811200

The other one has a perfect snug fit for my 6 inch wrist which was nice, but it wasn't as easy for me to read the face (even though that one is labeled Easy Reader) as this one is. So, I'm keeping this one and returning the other one. The fit on this one is a lot looser, and I do have to wear it up about one inch higher than usual, but I'm okay with that and it does stay snug in the new placement. If you have a wrist smaller than 7 inches, you might want to reconsider ordering this if you are expecting a snug fit.

The expansion on this one stretches very easily for taking on and off which I also like, the other watch was tighter for removing. However, this watch arrived with the battery tab already pulled, which I did not like. I prefer to remove the tab myself, which assures me that I am the first one wearing it. I have no idea now whether Amazon gave me one that was returned, or if they make it a practice to remove the tabs before sending. I bought this directly from Amazon and not from one of the other sellers, (even though the Amazon watch was a few dollars more) just because I prefer working directly with Amazon if I might return a product.

 I spent hours and many days before limiting my choices to these two watches, and I am happy with my final decision. The gold is softer than what is shown in the picture, if you watch the video you will have a better idea of how beautiful it is.

They quickly became the only brand of jeans I wear on the bike and still are. I particularly like being able to order my exact size, particularly the leg length. I'm a shade over 6' tall, and having heavyweight canvas jeans with 36"" legs makes sure there's plenty of material bunched over the tops of my boots to block the wind. They can get a little warm at rest stops on 80+ degree days, on the other hand they protect your legs better when you're back on the road in full sun.

I have a several pairs of these dungarees, a couple common-or-garden, a pair of flannel-lined for colder days so I don't have to bother with longjohns/thermals, a pair 2"" oversized waist for concealed carry or wearing over thick thermals/sweat pants/Levi's, and the faded old pair with the front knee panel worn through that are still plenty good enough for yardwork. These things last a long time.

One last thing - if you wash them inside out, the brass rivets won't smack around the inside of the washer and drier drums, and your vintage t-shirts, quite so hard; and if you dry them on 'Low', you'll have a better chance of fastening them the next time you put them on.

Original review:
I heard about Carhartt work pants as good bike pants over a year ago, and when my last pair of riding jeans wore out, I finally decided to risk $35 to find out. They were right. I've been riding bikes for 35 years, mostly in Lees and Levi's boot cuts, and a decade ago I discovered kevlar lined 'Draggin' Jeans', which are soft, comfortable and great peace of mind for well over a hundred bucks. These Carhartt double fronted dungarees may not protect my ass quite as much as kevlar, but they're as hard as nails and at around forty dollars including tax and freight, I don't need to look any more.

These pants are not far short of wire mesh straight out of the box. I washed mine four times on the long cycle, warm, with extra suds before giving them two rinses and throwing three fabric softener sheets in the tumble dryer with them. After more than 2,000 miles on the bike, lots of normal everyday wear and numerous more washes, these pants have not so much attained the soft like-a-deerskin-glove feel that favorite denim jeans do - it feels more as if it's shaping itself to my body....the double front keeps your legs warm from the pocket line to halfway down your shin, where your 8"" boots take over. They are not going to get you home dry through a thunderstorm, but they are more rain resistant than denim and they're just fine in light showers or on wet roads.

These pants sit most comfortably with the belt line at navel level, and they do it without wedging you. This makes a big difference to how cold your back gets after the first 50 miles. I usually take a 36x34, but got these in a 36x36, which are perfect on a bike - the extra 2"" stops them riding up past ankle height, even with feet on highway pegs at 70mph, there's less wind whistling up the canyon, and that helps keep you a lot warmer than those hip hugging waders...now that I'm used to them, I wear these pants all day, everyday, and I don't have to worry about getting changed into something more robust if I see a job that needs doing around the house, garden or garage.

I bought one pair to try. After a month and a thousand miles on the bike, I bought another black pair, and a 'Carhartt Brown' (that weird mustardy beige color) pair for gardening, hunting and camping. The pockets are roomy, and I fit my glasses case in the right hand tool pocket, cell phone in the left, and can hang a 4x D-cell torch through the hammer loop. I have a custom made 2"" wide leather belt which fits the loops, which it doesn't on 'normal' denim jeans. Because these sit at the waist, I can cinch them up and hang my Buck, Leatherman and a folding tool off it, on top of all the other aforementioned bits and pieces, plus wallet and loose change, all without risking walking out of my trousers. If superheroes wore jeans, this is what they'd wear.

They look pretty reasonable for a burger & beer night out, but after a few miles you might want to pull out the designer labels if you're going out to a real restaurant.

I'll be interested to see how long these things last. I'm thinking 'a while'.","The best value motorcycling pants I've ever bought. **And 4 or 5 years later, still are.",1278979200,

It's not as stiff as a nylon holster, snake chaps, brush guards, etc. I can still see it getting scuffed up and wearing out over time if you aren't careful with it. But i'm rough with my clothes (I'm kind of clumsy and scuff up against walls sometimes, and the like)
- Pretty comfortable when you're not sitting down, and even then it's not bad
-  I love the close-fitting cuffs which retract into the jacket and are hidden / protected under the nylon sleeve. That will keep the cuffs from getting soiled, wet, or torn on things. Also looks nicer t his way. Seems well designed
- The zipper is very heavy, and well built. It also doesn't catch, king, bind, etc. good zipper
- Nice big front pockets - I can conceal a small semi-auto pistol (eg ppks or lcp) in them easy. The front pockets are completely nylon, so they should last. The inner pockets are nice size also - one has velcro, the other has a zipper.
- Very flexible. There are pockets of extra material folded behind the shoulders which expand out when needed (when arms are extended).
- the jacket is not overly hot. It has a couple holes on each side near the arm-pits, not sure how much that would help though. It reminds me of a wool sweater, except that it also has better wind blocking abilities. But I could definitely wear it in a cold house (eg 65 - 68 degrees) without sweating. However it gets hotter when working - I was working in the garage with it (it was in the 40's) and I started getting sweaty and had to remove it.

Cons:
- the front top pockets could be a little bigger for my tastes (taller and maybe with side zipper pockets)
- would like zipper pockets on the front lower pockets, to hide things or keep them from falling out
- while the inside hidden pockets are nice, and are nylon, they don't have a nylon backing -- they are sewn into the lining material and could wear out if carrying abrasive or heavy items in there, over time
- when sitting the zipper does ride up against the bottom of my neck, but i don't care too much. I just unzip it a few inches and angle the top of the right zipper away a bit so that it can ride outside my chin rather than pointing into my neck. It's really not a big deal, just a little nuisance.
- while the jacket doesn't feel too big, it will look a little bigger and bulkier than your average jacket, and might look silly if you're wearing it in the late fall or early spring. I plan to only wear this in the winter time when outside (in the 30's or colder)

Overall i'm very impressed with this jacket and I'm tempted to buy the matching coveralls, even though I really don't have a use for them. It's just a nice thing to own (if you knew they'd quit making it, you'd definitely want to buy one before that happened)","Rugged, attractive jacket",1366761600,

In person,it's not a mellow color as it looks on my computer, but an eye-popping, very strong turquoise. Although it's a little too strong for my liking, I'm keeping them. The four-star rating is for the color. The sandal is five stars.

This pair is my sixth pair of Keens -- 2 Newport H2s, 3 Balis, and 1 other Venice. This new pair is much lighter than my other pair of Venice H2s, bought two-years ago. The foot base is narrower, making the fit slightly snugger for those of us with wide feet. The lighter weight should make walking distances less tiring. The question is whether the sandals hold up as well as the older ones. My other pair of Venice H2s were worn daily for a year while on a 6,500-mile sailboat cruise around the eastern U.S. and up into Canada. To clean them, I popped them into a washer and let them air-dry. They still look almost new.

Keen probably made the changes to the shoe to reduce manufacturing costs and make it more appealing to a broader market. Any other changes (webbing, fittings and such) will likely cheapen the shoe and cause Keen to lose its core outdoor market. I will continue to love and buy Keens until then.

UPDATE 3/27/16:  I just bought my third pair of  Keen Venice H2s, this time in Gargoyle, gray with a touch of brown. My first and second pair are still in great shape. This color is more neutral and will go with more clothes. We live on a boat six months of the year and at our house in the mountains the other six. These shoes are great deck shoes and great walking or hiking shoes.

I'm still concerned that Keen may be forgetting ""the one who brought her (sic) to the dance,"" the outdoor market.

I have diabetes & other problems, balance, etc. so I really can't wear most shoes anymore. My actual size is 6 wide, but they're hard to find. I usually have to get a 61/2, but they aren't correct for my feet. (too long & narrow) So, I wanted to try the 6, even though it wasn't wide. (I have Amazon Prime, so if they didn't fit I could return them free of charge.) They were on sale for $47; I never would have paid full price. When I got them & tried them on I was very very happy to find that they did fit me almost perfectly! They are really great for me. They feel like they were made for my feet! Seem to 'cradle' my feet exactly & provide 'full' coverage. (NOTE the picture.)Thay are not tight at all, & not loose. I like the way they sort of tip up in the front...very helpful so I don't trip. My feet are sensitive, as someone else had mentioned & you will feel those little 'pimples' on the inside. Doesn't bother me though. Wide enough so you can wear a reg. pair/thin sport sock with them. Also, you can put an insole (oder-eater, etc.) inside, as they will make your feet sweat, if you are prone, & your feet will slip around. But... because they are (well-made) plastic, in the hot weather you can just hose your feet down to cool off! They will be great for the summer, but I will wear them year-round with socks. I liked them so much, I just ordered another pair in red, & were $37.  I wanted sage & coral but they don't have them in a 6. My foot is 81/2 inches long & about 31/2 wide. I feel someone with a 7 could fit a 6. BUT I will say they are wide, and someone with a NARROW foot would not fit/like these in any size.

perfect fit...These were the only 3 colors of size 6 on sale. I am waiting to see if coral, sage & midnight come on sale soon. I have various/serious medical problems related to my feet.

Original review:
This is one of many pairs of Keen sandals I own. They sell more heavy duty soled(NewportH2) and lighter soled (Turin water shoes) sandals in these water sandal type. They are all comfortable and have their uses, but these are my favorite all around. They are a little more open, yet the straps all hit in perfect places in relation to my toes. The soles have a nice flex that is thick enough to make  a bluestone driveway a comfortable walk. They offer good support to avoid re-injury if you have suffered plantar fascititis. They stay on in the surf. My only complaint is that they will pick up sand and rocks (and stuff) while in the surf. Wear flip flops at the beach instead. These are my favorites for everything else. They are snug to pull on. Once on they disappear on your feet. Don't get better than that. I also find the red is lovely, does not show dirt. If you have never worn Keen sandals before, these are a good style to start with. I usually wear size 8.5W in shoes, these I went up 1/2 size (to size 9) and they are perfect. They will accommodate a wide foot, and the lacing will tighten to fit a slimmer low volume foot. The protective toe I have learned to love as it keeps much debris from between my toes when walking through the woods and fields.",Keen's Middle of the road sole,1369872000,

I think it might be fairly warm, but ""Arctic?""  I live in the north country, and we routinely have sub-zero days.  We have hit -26 for the morning chores, so we know cold.  So far, I've worn the jacket in 20 degree weather, and it's warm enough, but time will tell if it can handle the frigid days.  It is light, though, which is a plus.

The fit was good.  I wear a large, and a large in this jacket fit pretty well.  My wife says the shoulders are too big and I look like a football linebacker with it on.  I'm not so sure that is a bad thing.  I wouldn't mind being an NFL linebacker.  While others try to lose weight, I think if I put on 20 more pounds I can be an NFL running back.  I don't see any other 70 year old NFL linebackers, so there's certainly a niche there.  If the look of the jacket in the shoulders bothers you, avoid reflective surfaces and you'll be fine.

It's noisy, for sure.  The fabric is kind of stiff, and when walking the arms rubbing against the body makes noise.  That may or may not go away with breaking in.  Others have mentioned the jacket stands upright when you put it on the floor, and it sure does.  That doesn't bother me - I buy a jacket for durability and warmth, and this one promises to be durable.

The zipper is stiff.  I put some candle wax on the teeth and it smoothed out some.  I suspect it just needs breaking in.  The advantage of this zipper is that it is sturdy, and I can zip it with gloves on.  Carhartt went the extra step by using a good zipper.

The stretchy fabric on the waist is a plus for me.  It allows the jacket to stretch a bit, which allows wearing a sweater under it, and makes a good seal on the bottom.  It is a short jacket - raising my arms overhead, as in throwing a bale of hay, makes the jacket ride up considerably.  That's a small point, though.  The fabric on the cuffs is good - the sleeves are long, and on me the bottom of the sleeve folds over the elastic fabric on the cuff.

All in all, I think I'll like this jacket.  I expect to get at least five years out of a work jacket, and I hope this one will give that.

Revision:  We are in the middle of the Nor'easter of March 2018, and this jacket is a champion.  Right now we're having mid-20s temps, 30-40 mph winds, and blowing snow.  It's a damned blizzard, and this jacket takes it all.  It is truly windproof, and even in this weather I'm as toasty as a squirrel.  The hood really cinches down well over a stocking cap, which is a true plus in the blowing wind.

The item however was not exactly what I was looking for and that is only due to my purchasing it online and not in a store. This jacket is thick and bulky with a rough tough exterior. The model in the picture makes it look a bit slimmer than it might be to actually wear. I wear a small, and while the dimensions are correct the thickness and stiffness of the material makes the baggyness in the arms feel excessive. I think if you wear a larger size, the thickness to surface area ratio decreases making it more comfortable to wear. Just my idea.

Like I said before the quality is great, feels indestructible. I love the lining, I wish I could get this lining in a hoodie jacket all throughout. The j140 only has the lining in the body if I recall correctly. The sleeves are a nylon quilt or something smooth so sleeves won't drag. I don't like to wear anything under jackets so this doesn't matter to me.

I checked out carhartt's 3 season zip hoodie and tried that out after returning this one. It is like a hoodie jacket hybrid which I prefer so I don't look like i'm ready for winter when its just a little cold out. The lining is not as good though, nylon I think rather than flannel. If I could combine the best of these two items I would pay plenty. Maybe I overlooked that option on their website?",Great quality product but not what I am personally looking for.,1480550400,

I also got them 2 Sizes Longer so when I am Sitting they will not ride up above my Boots.
I have a Perfect fit because I have room to move and to sit with my Clothes on under it but if I had bought the Size I wear it would have ben to small to wear my clothes under it.

However, once below that, I switch to this jacket.  It has the artic liner in both the jacket and hood and is very durable.  Most of my co workers and construction worker friends of mine will only wear Carhartt gear.  I've already been outside in 30 degree weather with no issues. And I hate the cold too.  The shell of this jacket is weather resistant as well and should keep you protected from snow or rain.

With all that said, I only gave my review 4 stars out of 5.  The reason for this is because I find the hood to be annoying when not in use.  The hood is very stiff and wants to be up at all times.  Several occasions now I'll be walking with the hood down, and it'll just pop right up on its own or constantly rub on the back of my head.  I did run the jacket through the washer and dryer while following directions on the tag.  I also added fabric softenor to the wash machine.

Prior to buying Dickies I purchased Carhart work pants and was satisfied with them. So when I decided to order more work pants I shopped around on Amazon and found the Dickies for around $8 a pair cheaper then the Carhart brand. I read the reviews and decided that I would give them a try. I should have passed on them instead. While the pants might be perfect for others thet are not for me for a few reasons. The first is the belt loops. Yes others mentioned them and you must sometimes keep an open mind while reading the reviews on Amazon but everyone who mentioned the problem with the beltloops was 100% correct. So for me to put on my DICKIES belt, I must put the belt thru the loops BEFORE I put the pants on. This is crazy! Once I put the pants on and use the belt I can't put the excess belt thru the loops because there is no room. I have never in my life had this happen. Next the material is not as heavy as the Carhart brand. I do not think they will last as long but I could be wrong. The last was that one pair of pants arrived with the logo sewed upside down on the pants. Now in my world that would make these seconds. Which is bothersome that I was charged for first quality and maybe these were rejected pamts that Amazon picked up on the cheap. Just a thought on my part.

Screw those mean girls that say, ""you just aren't wearing the right bra."" Uhhh, no. I've been fit by the professionals at Nordstrom, Victoria Secret, and some fancy-pants lingerie houses with no luck. Within a few weeks, my bra straps slip, no matter how much I tighten them. Turns out, I have narrow shoulders and have met many narrow-shouldered ladies with the same problem (you know who you are--over the shoulder purses can also be problematic).  Wacoal's T-back bra solves that problem! After I had my baby, my breasts just did not return to what they used to be. When my son turned one, I had to suck it up and buy a new bra size. I liked the everyday design of this Wacoal bra, with a T-back with a front clasp. Sounds cool, right? After wearing this bra for a few weeks here are a few observations:
*Wacoal's T-back design has a regular bra strap shape, but the straps attach to the back strap closer to the center, almost making a V. There is a few inches gap between the straps, keeping them two completely separate straps. So it isn't a true T-back like the Maidenform bra, which looks more like a racerback bra. I like this style better than a true ""T"" shape, because it doesn't make the skin between my shoulder blades itch. It does pull a little on your shoulders near your neck, which only bothered my shoulder with a trapezius injury after an 8 hour day. My uninjured shoulder did seem to be bothered by the pull.
*The bra is made of very thin, stretchy fabric, which I personally like. I know that some women don't feel thin fabric offers good, full support. I haven't had a problem with support in this bra. But the thin fabric does NOT give you good nipple coverage, so if you are wearing a thin shirt beware you could ""nip out.""
*Some women have complained this bra feels cheap because of the thin fabric, thin feeling underwire, and it's small, cheap-feeling front clasp. When I pulled this bra out of the bag, I could totally understand why. The front clasp is small, and if you aren't careful I can see how you could break it. Despite it's size, once on the bra has stayed in place and provided support through an 8-12 hour work day running around a hospital. The clasp has yet to break or fail and un-clip. I'll update this review if anything like that happens, but after a few weeks of use, so far so good.",PERFECT IF BRA STRAPS ALWAYS FALL OFF YOUR SHOULDERS!,1522886400,

Granted, the first time I tried it on, before adjusting the straps, it was quite snug, but the elastic quickly adjusted to my body and it feels great (you do want a bra to be snug in the band, otherwise it will offer no support).

I have no clue as to why, but as soon as I put these on, they feel as if they are all bunched up. You know that feeling when you put a maxi pad on, and it's one of those old-fashioned thick bulky types? That is the exact same feeling I get when putting these on. Weird, right?

I expect to wear & love this bra long enough to get my money's worth !
comfortably wide straps.
overall comfort very good

Cons:
shows too much strap
most of my scoop neck & square neckline tops did not cover the straps...bummer since this is the first bra in a long time to fit & be comfortable
It was a perfect fit for me, but because it opens in the front, it's not adjustable around your chest, so that may be an issue for some ladies

get the same bra without the T-strap back!

Here is why:

Important to note:  I am a petite girl (5'1) with 32DDs. Generally it is difficult for me to find bras that have small enough straps but yet are still flattering.

1) This bra has NO padding. This is important to note, NO PADDING. Some reviewers wrote that there was some padding as to not show any nip when cold. I found this to be very untrue. It was quite obvious when I was cold.

2) Runs small. I wear a 32DD in most other brands but could barely get the bra to close.

3) Closes in the front. At first I thought this would be a cool new feature in a bra (I've never had one that does that before) but I quickly found it to be incredibly annoying. When you've got large girls, you kind of feel like you're being swallowed by them when you're trying to push them together to get the bra to close. It was an unpleasant and difficult experience.

4) Not attractive. Look, I have huge boobs, it is really hard for a bra to hide that fact (I don't mind). But this bra was something else. I legitimately felt like a little boy wearing it (again, hard to do when your boobs are huge). It was just very unflattering. The model in the picture has some nice clev going on...this definitely didn't happen for me.

Pros:
1) It was a racerback.

End result: Not sure what everyone else is talking about, but it is not worth the money (Note: Money is not the deciding point. Even if it was cheaper I still wouldn't get it). I can definitely find another bra for this price that is much more flattering.",Great Disappointment,1374710400,

I liked the cotton briefs w/elastic leg for sleeping. I tried other brands, but no elastic legs and they were cut different so they rode up your bum or left part of it showing, not comfortable! I stumbled across these during a Google search for ""elastic leg cotton panties "" and was surprised by how closely they resembled the Sears panties (side by side comparison, I swear they're the same). I wear a size larger than my everday undies for sleeping, for comfort and ""breathing,"" so I ordered an 8, same as I did in Sears.  Wow, I reviewed huge granny panties! I lay the Sears on top of these and thought, these are going to be saggy, baggy, undies. Then I read a review they shrink, so I washed them, dried them and low and behold, they are now a perfect size 8! They run a bit higher in the waist than the old Sears panties (great when your bloated), and the legs are cut a little different, but not much. They fit much like a full coverage bathing suit bottom and cover every inch of you bum, but don't sag, nor are they too snug. I do find a little extra ""leg"" around my hip / top of leg area, but that doesn't bother me, pull them down, or up, the elastic will hold them. They do not roll, move, scrunch, bind, or anything else you can think of, I'm loving my new ""replacement"" undies!

Thelma and Louise are real but such a pain in the arse to fit and have the bra stay put.  I loved this bra from the moment I put it on.  The back strap is all one piece and quite wide, eliminating the back fat and giving it that solid base to stay put.  I saw that another reviewer stated the bra seems to pull the breasts outward in an odd direction and make them pointed.  I have absolutely no cleavage and can actually ball up my fist and stick it between and not touch anything, so the way this separates and hold feels quite natural to me and I welcome anything that doesn't make me look soo round.

The elastic holds pretty well, although I haven't worn these for an extended period of time. They don't seem like they will snag and run as most cheap nylons do.

The band seems pretty stretchy, I fastened it on the tightest hooks right out of the bag, so it would go back even if the cups fit. I'm usually a 34G/H in US sizing and 34F/FF/G in UK sized bras. I measured the cup depth as 12.3"" wire-to-wire and the height from the base of the underwire to the top seam is 8.5"". Bratabase.com says the Panache non-wired sports bra in 36FF has similar measurements! This bra has US sizing and is available in up to a G cup which I'm guessing will fit like a UK G or GG. The gore is a little wide for me at 1.5"" where the wires end. The gore is 4"" tall from the base of the underwires to their ends.

This bra seems pretty nicely made for the price. The cups are lined with a perforated CoolMax fabric that is supposed to wick away moisture. The seams are covered and the underwires are well padded. It feels very soft and comfortable to wear. I can't answer for motion control of course but the shaping looks pretty good even if it's a bit pointy. There is a seam along the tops f the cups and there is fabric above that covers the chest so you don't have to worry about falling out if you're doing an inverted pose.

I doubt I'll try a different size as I'm close-set at the top and the wide gore is a deal breaker for me. It could work well for you though if you have average width between your breasts and wear up to a G/GG UK size in a 32-48 band.

The underwire quickly (sometimes after a couple of wearings, sometimes after a month or so) works its way out from under its plastic cap, and then pokes through the fabric and into the wearer's breast (big OW!).  Alternately, if it comes uncapped on its inside-end, you can suddenly find it sticking out the neckline of a scoop-necked shirt (been there-- middle of the workday), but you're less-likely to be stabbed with it in this scenario.

Other than that, the fit is good, the support is great and I like the appearance of them.  I have successfully repaired a couple, cutting open the wire's channel, gluing the cap back on, and stitching them back up (yes, that's how much I like them), but that doesn't always work.

If Lunaire can fix this one defect, it might become the perfect larger-size sports bra.

For Reference:  I am 52 tall and 110 lbs and gave birth at 38 and again at 40  so my old body didn't bounce back from birthing like a 20 year old body would.  Women often tell me, Oh you're skinny why do you need shape wear?  Well, because Im almost 50 and my middle, hips and thighs are becoming flabbier than Id like despite my best efforts otherwise.  I want shape wear to hold me firm under my clothing and enhance my figure.

Ordinary shape wear (like a Spanx body suit) is sweet and offers a a certain firmness to the body underneath clothing, but for serious shaping and firming, they don't do the trick.  So, here I sit wearing the product I am reviewing.
Initial thoughts when putting it on 5 hours ago:  O.M. G. how in the world is this going to fit?  I installed it around me over the (mostly stretched out) piece of full body shape wear I already had on, fastening it from the bottom to the top.  Ah, once fastened, it was definitely tight, but thats what it is supposed to do:  Mission Accomplished.

I was hoping for more lower belly control;  Id like to see the lower belly region taken up about an inch to flatten the belly more.or see the bands continue both around and downwards for another few inches to offer tighter control.  As it is, the bands do not cover the front of the belly region, there is an area 6 to 8 inches wide in front from top to bottom with no extra support built in,  so everything squished in by the side bands ends up poking out the front, instead of compressing in evenly around.

  The bands around the girdle definitely make the garment cut in to your sides, thus forming a sharper waist line, but they don't hit my around my true waist line unless I pull it up too high; when I pull it up higher (right under my bust), the lower part of the girdle wraps around right at my hip bones, thus my fat hips bulge out from under it.  Not a problem under my  jeans, but could be under a slinky dress or slacks with light fabric.  When I pull the girdle down to fit my hips properly it takes my waist line down lower than I feel it should.

Later I still wore it as I drove my car.  Do not wear this if you have a long drive!  The top of the whale bones will gouge in to your body, and I thought if I had a wreck, they might puncture my rib cage completely.  At church, sitting in a pew for a long time, I had to remain very upright or they would also gouge in to me.  Here at my computer, I am very aware of the tops of all the whale bones, I feel them sort of cutting in to my skin under my bust line and around my back.

But  better posture is a good thing, right?  In a way, I sort of like the reminder to sit up straight, as a secretary I sit all day and slouch too much and suffer back pain.  Maybe this will help.

Other thoughts, under my ribbed pull over turtle neck, the garment doesnt really show, except the front where the thing clasps together, there is a definite line there that bulges out somewhat.  Under this black ribbed shirt its hard to see in passing, but under other things I imagine it would be a big seam-line showing through.  I also believe it would be uncomfortable if I did not have a Spanx body suit under it; against my bare skin I think this would be awful, but I don't know yet.

Sexiness:  I guess that is a matter of opinion.  I removed the garter stocking straps to wear this under my dress jeans, but part of the purchase was to find a girdle with garters to wear under a wedding gown.  In an old school retro kind of way, this is sexy, but in a slinky sex kitten way, its probably not.

Final thoughts:  My waist line really isn't my problem, I have a decent waist.  My body problem is my lower belly and hips more than anything.  I wish it had more lower belly control and will continue to look for a girdle with that feature, but all in all I like this one, because if nothing else, as an older woman, I feel sexier having firm wear under my office clothing because I prefer a fitted / tailored look to my attire, a womanly look, and wearing this (and other shape wear) just makes me feel Womanly.  My man likes the body suit shape wear items, I am not sure what he will think of this, probably too aggressive for his taste in seeing me wear it (see it without a shirt over it I mean).  When you touch your body, you can feel the whale bones (I know its not real whale) and really feel the front closure strip.

I have to give this garment a good score.  It was shipped very fast; it appears to be quite well made; it does what it said it would do (cut a waist line); it forces me to maintain good posture, and this product actually comes not only in MY size, but a size smaller too!!!  Im wearing a Small, theres also an extra Small.  A company that realizes women of all sizes want shape control!  Thank you!!!!!!

That said:  This is one of the most UN comfortable things I have ever worn in my life (who said looking beautiful was comfortable?).  In fact, I think it wins the prize for discomfort.  It is extremely stiff (like it is supposed to be), and feels very bulky to me.  I keep checking my look in the mirror expecting to see the extra bulk that I feel on my body.  I will continue to diet and exercise with the hope of turning back the clock on my firm flat body of yesterday, but in all honestly  we all know the girdle is here to stay, it's just a matter of finding one that works with my body best.  Despite the discomfort, and as much as I'd like to hate this thing, I can't.  I like the way it makes me look and feel, but I will continue to shop for a better replacement to it for my particular body type.","This is a Girdle, not your typical Shape Wear - there's a big difference!",1424822400,

I've gained about fifteen pounds over the last year, growing out of several dresses and skirts with a 25""/26"" waist. I bought the XS based on reviews, but I really think I should have gone with the S. The XS does reduce my waist to its old dimensions, but it is so tight that it buckles and gaps a little at the front closure.

QUALITY: The shaper itself is very well made and good quality, BUT the loops for attaching the garters, and the garters themselves, were developing loose threads and wear right out of the box. The boning has developed a little bend that pokes me in my right side, but I suspect that is because my posture has never been straight and the shaper is simply adapting.

PERFORMANCE: I've worn this five or six times already, and it does very well. It can become a little uncomfortable, but as I said I think it's a little small. I also broke it in with three 12-hour days at a convention - not smart. Does it roll? Yes, but only when the garters are unattached. They are at least good strong garters and I've only had a few problems with them coming unhooked at the top during wear. (The clasps are standard and I've attached them to sheer stockings, costume fishnets, and thick socks without a problem.) Of course it gives you a lovely, straight figure and makes you look very put together. As a side effect, I find that my stomach is so squished that I don't get very hungry while I'm wearing it, and certainly can't eat much. On the other hand, it constricts the bladder too, so prepare for bathroom breaks.

OVERALL: I'm glad I own this, and I'm going to continue wearing it on a regular basis until I feel the need to get a new one. However, I will definitely be upgrading instead of replacing.

They are sturdily made and have held up over time. The first one that I bought is now four years old and still is in good shape. They are also a firmer control than many other products that I have tried over the years, which I like and was looking for.

On the fit:

I am 5'9"". Four years ago, I weighed 215ish lb. I bought the 3X/36, and it fit well. It didn't roll (which is a sign that it is too small) but it also provided a firm compression.
I have in the past year or so lost a lot of weight. I now weigh 170 lb. I was still wearing the 3X waist cincher, but mostly just for the smoothing affect as I had shrunk too much to get much compression from it. So since I liked the first one, I purchased another, this time in size XL/32. It also fits relatively well, but I think this is the smallest size I could possibly get at my current weight and still be able to get it on--it is a TIGHT compression. That said, in another couple of months I should drop another 5 lb or so and it will fit perfectly.

I've never had any problems with mushrooming out of these cinchers, but I suspect that is more a matter of finding the right fit and the tendencies of one's own body than anything to do with the waist cinchers themselves. But it also helps that it gets slightly looser at the top and bottom.

The first one I got was black and the second is white. I definitely liked the black better as it was less see-through. I also suspect that over time the black holds up better to stains/discoloration. But as it is worn under the clothes, it really makes no difference.

By the way, don't unclasp the front as it is near impossible to put on that way. Simply pull/roll it on and off over your head.

The only problem that I've occasionally had with these is that the front clasps are somewhat visible through some of my clothes as they are a slightly raised ridge. However, I've never had anyone comment on it, and frankly, I'd be surprised if anyone but me even noticed. Given that everyone pulls it on without unclasping it, I'm not sure why these clasps exist at all. It would be better if it were just a smooth front panel.",would and did buy again,1416268800,

I bought the waist cincher with garters because it was cheaper than the version without and then just took the garters off.  I do want to invest in a pair of thigh highs though.

But I do agree with other reviewers who complain about the product digging into your flesh. However, I offer solutions. First, I think that perhaps some are not wearing the undergarment properly. The woman in the pic is wearing the cincher just underneath the bra. So what I did to eliminate digging is to tuck the chincher under my bra a bit (in the front and back). And this did help to eliminate this a bit. However, what really eliminated digging was to wear one of those control top type pantie girdle thingy majiggs on top of the underwear and cincher. I noticed this eliminated another issue as well. The control top panties hid the ribbing. Unfortunately, the chincher ribbing is visible through my shearer form-fitting pencil skirts. But with the control top panties the ribbing outline is not visible. I hope this helps someone. F.Y.I. I am a size 10 curvaceous woman. However, I've let my figure go to pot so my waist is large.

It's always been difficult for me to buy cinchers that support a small body. I am only 5 ft, about 100 lbs and my measurements are 33, 24, 34 and I feel like I'm pretty straight up and down. The size is 24 and my waist is 24 so it made me worry that it would just ""fit"" me, but not give me the ""cinching"" hourglass figure that I wanted.

When I got the package, I tried on the cincher immediately. It fits perfectly!! It cinches right where I wanted it to. This cincher is made really well with soft support boning. The cincher also has tighter straps inside that are horizontal right where I want it to cinch in (to give me the hourglass look). It cinches perfectly at my waist. It also hugs me in the perfect spots of my lower stomach. Sometimes I have difficulty with other cinchers that cinch in the waist, but then pushes everything up top and bottom which gives a bulging look. This eliminates any bulging look and looks very sleak and natural under clothing.

The clasp front is very easy to put on (unlike corsets with strings in the back or spanx where you have to slip it on over the rest of your body). I also love the boning that helps with my sitting posture at work. If I start to slouch, the boning on upper top of the cincher will start to dig into the underneath of my breasts and remind me to sit up straight. I wear a slightly padded bra (with the padding underneath) to help with any bone piercing issues. I basically put the cincher over my bra at the base line underneath so if it does start to pierce, it pierces my padded bra first begins to hurt.

I've used spanx in the past or nylons with a control top to kind of give me the same look, but they seem to be more difficult to use. I buy an xs in spanx, but I always have trouble pulling it up and down because it's so tight. Once it's on, I love it, but taking it back off or having to use the bathroom can be troublesome. This cincher is great because it eliminates any bathroom issues. I never have to pull the cincher down (*note* I removed the garters). The garters are easy to remove with simple hooks. For a sexier look, I will add the garters with some stockings for some fun after hours at home. :)

I loved this cincher so much that I also bought it in white. I wish it came in more colors like tan or red. This is a great buy and I try and wear it daily. It's that comfortable. It's snug just how I like it. I also think it tightens my waist to 22""! 2"" smaller.",Cinchers are Sexy,1363564800,

I am active and tall with broad shoulders and a large frame and this style will cut across the top of my breast and make an indentation in the same size that is fine in other styles.

Fortunately, I received some 527's and 517's for Christmas (2016) and my faith has been restored. To begin with, I should note that I have the moves and physique like Jagger, and so when comparing with the 527's (slim-boot cut), I prefer the 527's much more for my physique. That said, here are some pros and cons for the 517's.

PROS:
Heavy duty denim. The stonewash is the same heavy duty denim that you were sporting back in 80's junior high school. No stretch or thin denim here.

Fit. Unlike my Wrangler boot (not cowboy) cut jeans, which I really like, these jeans will not be too tight for you. Nor will they be too loose. They fit perfectly over my boots.

For the reasons listed above, I find these to be a great pair of work jeans. They'll hold up, and you'll be comfortable while getting stuff done.

CONS:
Appearance. With my physique, I was very pleased when the modern fit became popular again. I don't necessarily feel too trendy while wearing the 527's, but I feel comfortable and normal. When i wear these 517's, I feel like I look my dad and grandpa 100 years ago. When they wore jeans like this, we all thought nothing of it because there were no other options. But now, with the 527's available, I prefer those. These seem just a little too roomy/boxy for my taste.

All in all, if you do not care for slim fit jeans or you're simply getting jeans to work in, these are a good choice. If you want to look a bit more modern, then perhaps consider the 527's.

Final note: if you want to know the weight of the denim jeans you are buying, you will have to head on over to the Levi's web site to figure that out.

I love these bras because they are comfortable, they provide good support, and they don't tend to create any lines under clothes. Good basic bras.

However, in the past year or so I've noticed a change in the sizing. Ever since I started buying these, I've been a 38B. Last year, though, I bought two of these in 38B to replace two others that I'd worn out, and the new bras felt waaay too small -- they cut in around my ribs and across my chest (which created a  wildly unflattering, spilling-over silhouette under my clothes! That had never happened with my old ones). To be fair, bras tend to fit snugly when you first buy them, but when I compared the new ones with the older ones, the cups on the new ones were a lot smaller: they did not come up as high across the front, and they were narrower across the bottom. I wonder if Maidenform switched manufacturers or something, because until then I'd always found the sizing consistent for this model, even across different colors. I decided to go up a size and see if that helped, and it did: the cups on the new 38C are about the same size as those on an old 38B (perhaps a hair larger across the bottom, but they give me the right coverage on top).

From the description, you'd imagine it to be a very similar cut, with just a higher waste, and less fitted legs. This is true in every aspect EXCEPT visually. The thigh and knee area on these 517's look to be smaller and tighter than the 527's, HOWEVER, the feel is noticeably less restrictive.

back then, Levis came out with a flared bottom, but was not bell bottoms, but were wider than 501's. they were not todays 517's.
They were skinnier or tighter at the knees, and wider at the bottom,but that was the fashion back then.
I love 501's. My 'thing' with them was the bottom opening was always so small.
ok for tennis shoes, but for wearing boots, they were too small around the ankle, making the entire boot look too long. simply because they were so narrow, the could not go down any lower on the boot.  hahaha
I love to wear black biker boots, with a taller 2' heel for easier shifting thru gears. these 517's are wider at the bottom, so the jean bottom rides lower on the boot, only exposing the very top of my round boots, so it looks sexy for a guy. I have had a lot of compliments from mostly women. they seem to like that look for themselves, most people like a smaller foot / shoe profile.
The 517's fit the hips, and butt better too. My 501's always make my butt look flat, these give it a little better shape. I work out, and do leg squats, so my butt is not flat! I wear the boots and jeans to work on our 'lax day' Friday.
Monday thru Thursday, its business casual, at least for us in the office.

3,42,TRUE,"06 25, 2014",A1V8ZE9BH0WTXE,B0001EMLIY,{'Color:': ' Black'},cinephiliagal,"Originally I wanted an oiled-leather bag like ""Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson"" carried on the TNT series The Closer. I'm not a purse person and not a girly girl at all -- but I sure wanted that bag. It looked big enough to fit in all my usual stuff, plus my nursing stuff (bandage scissors, stethoscope), plus a magazine or papers I need to review (continuing ed or yearly training stuff).

Sadly, that bag was made by the costume designer specifically for that character. The bag does not exist as something made that you can buy. So I looked for alternatives. I really hate polyurethane bags and the ""real leather"" bags that are PU bonded with leather (leather on the inside -- the outside is PU). I also hate designer bags and clothes with logos (unless it's a concert T-shirt, lol!). I wanted a PLAIN LEATHER BAG in black.

This bag looked like it fit the bill. It is grain leather instead of the shiny oiled leather of Brenda's bag, but the basic design was the same. So I bought it.

So far, it is a great bag. I've had it now a couple of weeks, now. As soon as I opened the package I knew it was real leather by the smell.

People have complimented me on the bag in the short time I've had it; some have asked where I got it.

I read the review from 2005 stating that the handles are too short to carry as a shoulder bag. Maybe the design of the bag has changed since then, because I am a ""big and tall"" girl, and I have no problem carrying this over my admittedly larger than average upper arms and shoulders.

The purse's main closure is one magnetic snap -- not a zipper.  It is pretty strong. It stays snapped shut if you don't stuff the purse full of tons of stuff. Inside there are three divided compartments. The one in the center zips closed; the two on either side do not. So if you want to secure something, you should use the center compartment and keep it zipped.

There is also has a smaller interior, zip-close pocket on one side, inside one of the open, divided compartments. A cell phone pocket with a velcro closure is on the opposite side of the purse in the other open divided compartment. The cell phone pocket is only big enough for an older flip phone. My Samsung Galaxy Rush (a smaller touch screen smartphone) does not fit in the cell phone pocket. So I keep my house and car keys in that pocket instead.

The fabric purse lining that makes up the 3 compartments is some kind of silky polyester fabric. It seems flimsy, but it hasn't ripped yet. (Will update this review if it does.)

I have tried to reduce the amount of stuff I carry in my bag. (I also carry a separate nursing bag with my usual nursing supplies; that helps reduce the stuff I carry in my purse.)
So for now I carry a small makeup bag (smaller than a small pencil case), my wallet, a couple envelopes of important papers, keys, pill box (w/naproxen, pseudo-ephedrine, antihistamines -- I have bad allergies), asthma inhaler (just in case, though I rarely need it), a pen or two, garage door opener, key-ring with all those plastic ""preferred customer""/member tags that don't fit in the wallet, house keys, car keys, extra set of car keys.

Even with all this stuff, there is room for a LOT more in this bag. But I don't want it stuffed chock full.

On top of all that stuff, I have thrown in an umbrella, my 7"" tablet, small water bottle (10 oz or less), and paperback. With the last 4 items, it was harder to snap it shut, but it did close.

The only thing I would change about this bag is *maybe* I'd give it a zip closure rather than a magnetic snap. But then, if it zipped, it wouldn't actually be like Brenda's bag. It would be more secure, though.

(I always figured Brenda's bag had a snap closure rather than zipper because it held her gun with holster and ammo clips, which all had to be quickly and easily accessible. My life is not that exciting, even with the recent passage of a CCW law here, lol.)

REVIEW UPDATE 9/16/14 --

Okay, problems that I've noticed with this bag:

The interior fabric easily forms loose threads. It hasn't frayed yet, but the loose threads were disconcerting. They happened relatively quickly.

The leather ""grain"" is actually some kind of coating. God, I hope it's not polyurethane, but I suspect it is. When the ""grain"" gets scraped off (by normal wear and tear! I don't abuse my bags!), the leather underneath is a whitish gray.

I have had to use black shoe polish to cover those scuffed areas once already, and I'm going to have to do it again.

The areas where the fake ""grain"" wears off are mostly edges -- like the top edge of it, and the edges where the rolled leather handle expands out into where it's sewn onto the body of the bag.

On the plus side, nothing has broken yet, and it remains a very sturdy bag with a large interior capacity for stuff.

Also, in practice, the handles are easily large enough to slip over even a large shoulder like mine.

Just wish they wouldn't have added the fake ""grain"" to this bag. Plain leather would have been fine.

When I first got it, one of my older sisters had a black Tignanello 100% leather bag. She saw mine and told me what a great bag I had. I told her how much I paid -- $39.99 -- and she was jealous. Her Tignanello bag had easily cost five times as much.

But due to the way the grain has worn off on various edges of this bag, now I don't want my sister to see my bag (at least not until I re-dye the worn-off ""grain"" with black shoe polish). I wish I had her bag instead.

I'm regretting getting this bag, instead of buying one of the more expensive real leather bags I was eyeing on Amazon. :-\  I should have held out for the more expensive bags.

I still think this is a leather bag -- inside.

It's just that the ""grain"" is not leather. It's some kind of coating, either sprayed on or molded on.

I don't know why they felt the need to add a ""grain"" to it, but they did, and the ""grain"" is definitely NOT leather.

Oh well.","Thick, sturdy leather, but ""grain"" is some kind of coating",1403654400,

I don't know if the design was different for the other reviewers but the bag I got is AWESOME.  If it has a zipper closure it would truly be the perfect bag.  The leather is durable not flimsy - I am hard on bags so it needs to be good.  The handles are thick enough to not cut into your shoulder yet long enough to wear as a shoulder bag- perfect again.  Anyone who said they are not long enough - I cannot understand unless the bag design was changed before I ordered because my recent purchase is the perfect drop - long enough to be a comfortable fit yet not too long so its falling off your shoulder or easy for someone to reach into.  Its divided inside into 3 sections.  The center is a thin zipper section which divides the bag into the 3 sections. This is where you can put an ipad or papers.  The other two nicely fit my oversized wallet, glasses cases AND a water bottle on one side, checkbook, makeup pouch and junk food (mommy stuff lol) on the other.  One interior wall has zipper pocket and the other a pouch for sunglasses or cell phone.  The inside is a nice soft CLOTH nylon/polyester lining, NOT plastic.  The bag smells heavenly, new leather smell.  Ordering another in black today.

The quality is much better than a Wal-mart special of this style. It feels sturdy and the toe guard is substantial and makes my big feet look smaller which is a bonus. If you're looking for lighter weight and not as concerned about support check into their Whispers style vs this one (Newport).,"Sturdy, comfortable, and supportive",1494806400,

I have worn Keens since developing Arthritis in my feet eight years ago. My favorite style, the Whisper slide, has been discontinued.  They were, and still are, extraordinarily comfortable, but they are just worn out.

I took early retirement and in the summer, I  wear knit pants or jeans if it's cool out, and shorts the rest of the time.  I could wear my Keen's with either and just by changing my top and accessories, I was able to wear my Whispers in comfort and not look out of place, except at the dressiest occasions.

Since the Whisper slide was discontinued, I have tried many styles of Keens (thank you, Amazon!) and had to return them all.  I thought these Newport's were going to be great for me because they offer very substantial arch support and they adequately cover my toes, which is a must, according to the doctors. I was thrilled because they were so cute.  Then, after wearing them around the house for four hours, I had to take them off due to extreme pain on the top of my foot.  That's a new pain!  Can I find a pair of closed toe sandals with no straps across my foot?

To my dismay, I guess it's time to hit the nearest shoe store and see what they suggest.  But, having said that, I remain true to my Keen's and by next year, who knows?  Maybe a pair of Newport's will fit me!  But this year, I'll have to return these and the adorable navy ones I purchased, as well.  But I strongly recommend them for all outdoor activities and for everyday.  They are machine washable if you air dry them.  You will get you compliments on them every time you wear them.  I just may keep my navy ones, although Amazon has nicely authorized both returns.

I walked around in them for a bit around the house while feeling these out before gifting.  I thought that the foot bed felt pretty cushy and would go a long way before getting achy feet.  I of course will never know if that is true, but my mom felt the same as I did when she tried them on as well.  She loves the green of these shoes.  Kind of surprising to me since they are like a neon green and she's not generally a person that wears such bright colors, but to each their own.  She plans on wearing these in the water while kayaking in the like, and otherwise.  I picked this shoe in particular because of the rubber toe box.

She liked using old tennis shoes for that type of protection but of course those won't last long or dry quickly.

I just bought my first pair this summer, too, and just had to get another pair because I needed a more neutral pair to broaden my opportnities to wear them. My first pair was beet red, and although I love the color, my  options with outfits were somewhat more limited. Now with this pair, I can wear one pair or the other almost whenever I want with my normal casual clothes. For me, these shoes are worth their weight in gold and I highly suggest you give these Keene Newport H2 shoes a try. I do have a suggestion:  for those of you who are confused about whether to get your regular shoe size, or to go up half a size as many suggest, order both if this is your first time to order this style of shoe, and try them both and return the pair that doesn't fit!  I believe the return shipping is covered, but you should double check that out.

I ordered this pair because there are several things I love about them. At age 63, I love the support they give me, while looking great and fresh. I love this style so much, that I am considering even wearing them with socks when it turns cooler out.  It will be difficult for me to change Keen styles because I am so hooked on this particular style.

I have learned that I can wear them, no matter the task at hand. If I am gardening and get mud on them, I just hose them down and set them in the sun. The webbing like material dries quickly and they look as good as new!  I find the colors to be colorfast and there is no bleeding of colors when they get wet. Well they are called H2, so I guess it is obvious this style handles getting wet really well!!

I understand what people mean when they mention a difference in these shoes based on where they are manufactured. My first pair was size 10 and made in Vietnam. My second pair was also size 10 but made in Mexico. I truely love them both, but they are different. I found the pair made in Vietnam to be a little longer than the ones made in Mexico. Because of the bungy cord, I just cinched up the longer pair a little more and that fixed the issue for me! The pair made in Mexico fit my foot perfectly and I didn't have to work at all on getting them cinched up to fit my foot. That was pretty special.

It is important to note that I sprained my knee and got slight tears in my miniscus in early July and these have been my go to shoes during my recouperation. Very simply, these shoes make me feel so secure with the support they provide.  The rubbery toe bed makes them feel so sturdy, too.

These shoes are very comfortable. I am someone who likes a wide footbed in the toe area of my shoes. As far as I am concerned, these shoes couldn't be any better!  As I mentioned there is the capability to cinch the bungy cord and make them perfect for your feet. Now that is pretty great, from my perspective. Certainly these shoes can be rather pricey but just check out the colors available in your size, and you will find the price varies from color to color.

They hold up very well, had to wear them on a hiking trip when I would normally wear my hiking shoes. All I had were these. Now this wasn't a paved rolling hill hike. Ascended 1100 feet in just under 1/2 mile. Very rough and rugged terrain, plus wet in the shadows of the other mountains.

When I first pulled the Newport H2s out of the box, I thought I finally had found the shoes for me. I walked around the house in them and noticed they were slightly squeezing my fourth and pinky toes together (in both shoes). The toe box seems to curve significantly in towards the inside ankle and isn't wide enough, but it didn't seem like it was narrow enough to cause problems. They also don't breathe all that well. As soon as I put them on, my feet began to sweat. However, I *really* wanted a pair of Keens, and figured these were the types of problems that are resolved after the break-in period.
Based on other people's reviews (""The first day I had them I wore them hiking through the mountains of Mexico"", ""I pulled them out of the box and wore them for 2 weeks straight while backpacking through Europe"", ""I wore these white water rafting and camping in the Grand Canyon"", etc., etc., etc.), I figured a day in an amusement/water park would be no challenge, and I decided I would give them a shot. I wore them to King's Dominion in Virginia.
I was wrong. I was so, so wrong.
The first two hours of the day were fine. There was a little pinching in the toes, but I had already expected that, and it wasn't unbearable. Around lunch time, I started noticing they were getting a bit more uncomfortable, and I couldn't figure out why. I took them off and dried my feet (again), I adjusted the bungee cord, I attempted to stretch my toes inside the toe box. Nothing really helped, but my other shoes were in the car, so I trooped on.
Then we stopped for dinner, and when it was over, I couldn't stand. I literally could not put weight on my feet with the shoes on. I pulled the shoes off of my swollen feet, and what did I behold? Blisters. Blisters, the likes of which you cannot imagine. The kind of blisters that leave calluses on the first try. They were on the bottoms of every single toe, and they were HUGE.

I bought them for a safari trip in the Masai Mara area of western Kenya.  They worked really well.  They're comfortable, breathable and supportive.

I had debated whether to just take my Chacos, which I have many pairs of and have for years considered the gold standard for comfort and support.  I have a narrow foot and love the way you can tighten the Chacos to fit perfectly.  These Keens don't permit quite that amount of tailoring but they do have a way to tighten them.  So in the end I decided to bring the Keens.  What swayed me was the rubber toe guard, and the additional side webbing, both of which offer more protection than the Chacos.

They were comfortable right off the bat.  The one thing I didn't like was that in sandy or pebbly areas little bits of stuff would get into the footbed and I'd have to stop to take them out.  Next time I might bring lightweight socks to wear -- not sure whether that would help.

I have pretty wide feet and very high arches, I have a lot of trouble finding covered shoes that fit me.  I usually give up and wear flip-flops, but even those are not very good for your feet and aren't going to cut it when it gets cold outside.

Here is what I have found after trying out three different Keen sandals (I wear a 7.5 normally, but a Keen size 8)

1. The Venice and Venice H2 are their widest sandals, in fact Keen said it's the widest shoe they make

2. The Newport H2 youth model (Youth size 6 = Women's size 8 *and WAYYY cheaper) has a very nice soft heel if you don't like the straps on this model

3. The Newport H2 Women's shoe differs from the youth in the heel design and it has more rubber on the bottom (i.e. the youth sandal will wear out faster), otherwise you're pretty much looking at the same shoe for less money

4. The Whisper model is lighter than the Venice (less rubber in the sole), but almost a bit ""softer"" and more comfortable feeling in my opinion.  Still, it's too narrow for my foot.

So, if you have average width or even narrow feet, I'd recommend these shoes or the Whisper model if you want something lighter and softer - also, go up a 1/2 size, every Keen sandal I tried above ran small.  The Venice H2's fit the width of my foot, but the heel strap was very tight and not forgiving.  I took one last chance on the Venice thinking the leather heel strap would give a little, and it worked, they fit perfectly.  If you're foot is EXTRA wide and at least a Women's size 9, Keen's recommendation was to try the men's version, as they are wider.","Really nice shoe, but not for those with wide feet (try the Venice)",1382659200,

Which means they are snug, which is what I wanted. This prevents unwanted shoe-sliding and foot-chafing. I refer to my new Keens as my ""robo-feet"". Rather than smothering my tootsies, like many utility shoes, they serve as a protective extension of my feet.

My go-to footwear for walking around in the summer has been Chaco sandals. Now, I alternate between these and my Chacos. These Keens are perfect if you know you'll be hiking around places where you want to protect your toes, such as wooded paths and some urban areas. I've also been swimming in a lake with them, and they came out pretty much as good as new. (The cloth straps are water-resistant) They are also good for running errands and other activities, which you need to wear shoes, but you don't want to think about your shoes once they are on your feet. There are no laces to come untied, and these never become too uncomfortable that I'm dying to take them off once I get home. I only really notice them when I want to marvel at how awesome they are.

* Two snap closures on the front, and a wrap around snap closure. This opens up the credit card slot section. Really like this feature! Three large card slots and 9 regular size slots (one side runs vertical, and the other horizontal). And a pocket behind each side (presumably to slide a checkbook or what have you).

* In the middle section there is 3 pouches for cash, receipts, etc. And a zippered pouch for coins. Great place to stash misc. business cards as well.

* Two ID slots. I particularly like that these have a sturdy mesh window -- as opposed to the cheap clear plastic type. One of the ID windows is quite small, so it's pretty much useless to me.

Now that I have had the opportunity to wear them a number of times, I have to add that they ""feel better"" than my six year old version.

I finally popped into a retail store last month and tried them on in blue.  3 steps -- that's all it took and I knew why they were so popular.  Comfort!  But they were still a bit clunky looking to me.

So I went home and wore my sneakers and thought about the Keens.  The easy comfort.  The idea of no snubbed toes.  Finally, after a glass of rationalization called vino rouge, I ventured onto Amazon and purchased them in black/canton.

They arrived within the week which was quicker than expected.  I put them on.  Looked it the mirror and thought they looked really ugly.  I walked around the apartment.  My feet were really, really pleased.

That was last Friday.  A week. I have worn them every day.  There was no break in period.  No discomfort.  I've walked my dog 2 miles in them every day .  I've worn them to work.

After looking at way too many product reviews, I narrowed it down to five different straps and put them to the test.

The Contenders:
 Victorinox Comfort Fit Shoulder Strap
 OP/TECH USA SOS Strap for bags
 Skooba Superbungee Strap
 Travelon Shoulder Strap
 Klein 58889 Padded Adjustable Shoulder Strap

The Klein Strap is really intended for tool bags.  As such, it is extreme duty.  If I wanted to take a bag to war, this would be the strap Id get.  I cant imagine it ever breaking or falling apart.  That said, it is not going to work for extended carrying (ie., running through airports)  its just not comfortable enough for extended use.

The Travelon strap gets good reviews and it is moderately comfortable.  The shape of the padding allows it to be easily thrown over either shoulder and the price is right.  However It slides.  There just isn't enough grip on the padding and it easily slips off your shoulder.  If you wear your strap across the chest like a messenger bag, then his is probably the one to get.

The Skooba strap.  Its large and in charge  probably the most comfortable of the five straps, but you're certainly paying for the comfort  this isn't cheap.  The bag feels 50% lighter with this strap compared to the others  the suspension system really works.  But, it also slides  there is just not enough grip in the padding to keep it on your shoulder.  If you have small shoulders, its even worse due to the width of the padding.  The padding width and lack of curve also makes across the chest carrying awkward.

The OP/TECH.  Again, the price is right and a close second in the comfort department to the Skooba.  I really like this strap, has enough grip to stay on your shoulder without sliding and the neoprene really works to reduce the feeling of weight.  Added bonus in that the straps can be disconnected from the hooks and can be fed through a buckle system.  However, this strap just doesnt feel like its going to hold up to heavy use.  It feels somewhat lightweight.

The Victorinox.  This strap excels in the grip department  I have absolutely no fear of this thing slipping off my shoulders.  The padding is moderately comfortable, maybe just slightly more comfortable than the Travelon, but nowhere near the OP/TECH or Skooba.  It appears well constructed and looks like it will hold up to heavy use (and it should, given the price).

Final results?  None get 5 stars.  The Victorinox is going on my laptop bag.  It has the right mix of grip/durability and comfort, but at the highest price of all five.  Im keeping the OP/TECH as well and will use it for a lighter bag  Ill report bag on whether it holds up long-term.  If it does, then it may graduate to the laptop bag and become the final 5-star winner.

The other three straps are going back.  In the end, they just didn't make the cut for my usage.
----------12/28/2016----------
After 3 years thought I'd revisit this review.  I'm still using the Victorinox on a daily basis on my laptop bag.  The strap has actually outlived 2 bags at this point and, aside from a little discoloration of the black plastic ?plastic? at the strap/shoulder pad connection, still looks and performs as brand new.  Exceptionally pleased with the product and changing it to 5 stars.

FWIW, the Op/Tech is still in regular use on my camera bag (dslr, so not exactly a light weight).  While it doesn't get the same use and abuse as the Victorinox, it also looks and performs as brand new and I'm very happy with that strap as well (albeit I still don't think it would hold up to the usage of my laptop bag).",Search for the perfect strap,1391817600,

I also have an OP/Tech SOS strap that is not curved.  Both are fine and both would do the job of carrying a 15-20 pound bag.  Pretty strong metal hardware on each end of the strap to hook on to whatever bag it is carrying.  This kind of strap has a little give or play when attached to a bag, and the effect of the give or play is that it makes whatever you are carrying feel more stable.  At the same time the play in the strap seems to equalize the weight of whatever you are carrying, the effect of which when you are walking along your bag bounces less from the vibration of your stride - net net is that you are more comfortable carrying your load.

I also have a couple of OP/Tech straps for my DSLR cameras.  That was originally how I became aware of the OP/Tech brand.

Frary,"It's not easy to find a good shoulder strap and the OPTECH SOS is among the better designs: comfortable, lightweight, strong and easy to install/remove. The nylon strap webbing is standard issue for travel and camera bag straps and the metal hooks are good but nothing out of the ordinary. What sets this strap apart is the comfy neoprene shoulder pad: soft, grippy and wraps around the contour of your shoulder with any load. If you've used a strap with a stiff pad that bites into your shoulder like a hungry dog, you'll appreciate how this pad molds to your body and evenly distributes the load.

The comfort level of this strap compares well with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Victorinox-Comfort-Fit-Shoulder-Strap-Black-One-Size/dp/B003JH7MT8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Victorinox Comfort Fit Shoulder Strap,Black,One Size</a>. The Victorinox has a wider, thicker and longer neoprene pad and, thus, edges out the SOS for heavy loads. However at $18 the SOS is 40% less expensive and perfect for camera bags, messenger bags or any light to medium duty load. I use the SOS on a fiberglass (ultra lightweight) classical guitar case, and my shoulder feels blessed compared to the original strap. Worked well on my camera bag too.

There is a small gotcha with heavier loads, e.g., guitar case: the neoprene shoulder pad stretches and contracts as you walk, resulting in a slight bounce. No a problem for lighter loads like typical messenger or camera bags. The Victorinox shoulder pad is also neoprene but doesn't bounce due to the use of thicker material.

Finally, this fine strap is made in the USA while most straps, e.g., the Victorinox, are made in China (my OPTECH camera case is USA made as well).  Kudos to OPTECH for thinking outside the corporate box and manufacturing a quality USA product at a reasonable price.","Comfy, light, strong and priced right at $18",1377820800,

  - swivel clips
  - a smooth side and a grippy side, the smooth side is good for more delicate fabrics, the grippy side is great for stability
  - Adjustable length from both sides
  - Clean look / appearance - not what I would call boardroom style, but sufficient for most business uses
  - and last but certainly not least - stretch material on the pad section.

This is the first strap that I have used that offers stretch on the pad and I wanted to write a few thoughts about what this does for the strap. First the stretch adds to the comfort of the strap. It seems to mold to my shoulder and clavicle and therefore it feels as though the pressure of the bag is spread more evenly across the pad material. The weight distribution is the best that I have felt and I have used straps in the past that had pads with larger surface areas than this one. As a consequence of the distribution of weight, the strap makes it feel as though the bag actually weights less than one would expect. There is a dramatic ah-ha moment the first time you pick up your bag - you know the one that you have picked-up hundreds of times and have a very well defined (and expected) weight and feel on your shoulder, and yet suddenly you realize it is not straining your shoulder and back as much.

A potentially negative note on the stretch - if you carry a particularly heavy bag and attempt to run or walk fast (as I tend to do when trying to catch a train or a flight) your bag may ""bounce"" around a lot due to the stretch material. I have found that by keeping the overall strap length to a minimum (shorter than I typically use), I have been able to minimize the ""bounce"" effect. I do not find this issue to be big enough to take a star away - although I wanted to note this in case others might be more concerned about this.",Stretch is the Key to Comfort - Who Knew?,1363737600,

I could only wear the bag on my torso.. just to the side a bit, which not only doesn't feel good but looks silly. The only other way I was able to wear the bag was right against my hip, and my arm would constantly bang into the bag. I need a longer strap that I can use to sling the bag far enough behind me so that it is not in the way. Right now I'm using a guitar strap with my camera bag. Much longer, much better.

This strap is not the only one made by Op/Tech that has gotten a bad review because of being too short. One of their camera straps was also reviewed negatively here on Amazon, by a gentleman who is as tall as I am. He had to buy 2 strap extenders. I looked for strap extenders for this strap here on Amazon, but did not find any, so I'm returning the item.

Op/Tech makes instrument straps under the brand name Neotech. I'd once used a Neotech bass guitar strap, and didn't like it at all. It was long enough at least, but not comfortable. For bass guitar, I found that a thickly padded strap was much better than one with a stretchy part in the middle.  Still, I think if this bag strap were longer, I'd be keeping it. Apart from being too short, it does appear to be made well. Also, unless you carry bricks in your camera bag, chances are your bag will be a whole lot lighter than my bass guitar, so this strap with stretchy part in the middle might be excellent.

Op/Tech makes tons of products, and their items tend to get lots of favorable reviews. It is possible I might find one, or even many Op/Tech products I will like. But, in the future, I will make sure to try any Op/Tech straps in a store first before buying.

Personally these have been my favorite pants to launder. They don't stain easily, don't wrinkle that much and get nice and soft after a few washes. HOWEVER, there is a huge annoyance if you've got a muffin top. The top of the pants will roll out when wearing a belt and the white on the inside is visible.

I wear a size 38, and ordered a 40. A 42 would have been better as I can't button the side buttons. The 30 length seemed to be very long as I had to make 3 inch cuffs on the bottom.

 These overalls are very comfortable despite being a thick denim.  The thick material is beneficial if your using these for work. I seriously doubt I will ever wear these out. The threading and stitching are heavy duty. The buttons are well secured and hold securely. The thick material gives you protection when working. There is a lot of room along the waist line and they are not confining or tight. This allows you to move about more freely than if you have jeans on.

The side pockets are huge and can fit just about anything. There are two top front pockets and a cell phone will fit perfect in them. There are loops to hold tools on the side, and it held a heavy hammer with no problem. Just as a note, the side pocket held a large measuring device, two pliers, two screw drivers, hinges, screws, pocket knife, and a can of soda. That's one pocket! The back pockets are enormous! You could fit two wallets in each one, but of course sitting would be impossible. Each pocket is well stitched with very thick lining. Think industrial when it comes to pockets.

The ability to move and bend more freely is great, especially if you are working outside. Once you wear these, it's all you'll want to wear. Working on my car, I can carry everything I need in the pockets. Working the garden, I can carry anything and getting up and down is so much easier than wearing jeans.

The Medium vest fits me, as I found out from another reviewer of my size and build, not too lean, not real fat up top.

So, I look forward to using this jacket all year round, depending on the weather, as a windbreaker in fall, spring, and summer, and as an outer shell in the winter with layers underneath. It is a substantial jacket, as far as thickness goes, but not too thick. I like it a lot. The buttons are very good, and this makes it easy to open and close.

 I wear a 32 inch waist in jeans. I followed the advice of others on here and ordered two sizes up - so a 36 inch waist. I got them and cannot button the upper waist buttons on these at all and I know cotton duck shrinks when dried - so back they go.

Revised December 4:

I re-ordered. I ordered a 38 inch waist for my 32 inch waist and they fit. The tag in these overall says they are made in the United States. I hate to be cynical but I find it hard to believe that we cannot make a product for a man with a 32 inch waist that says ""32 inch waist"" on it. For some reason we make a product that says ""38 inch waist.""

 If anyone is going to make America ""great again"" I hope they will start by learning how to read a tape measure.  If I knew of an alternative to Carharts I would buy them but I don't know of any. I stopped buying clothes from L.L. Bean years ago for the same reason: nothing fits in a consistent way. It seems to me the trouble with men's clothing companies that specialize in workwear is that the people who are involved and the conception and production of the products  do you not have calluses on their hands or sore backs at the end of the day. They are young marketing people and most of them have probably never worn a pair of overalls in their life. I imagine Carhart started as a company of people who had some farm experience and tried to make a better pair of overalls and they did that themselves knowing what overalls needed to be.  It's a different world now where the end-user is completely divorced from the process  geographically, logistically, spiritually.

They are the gold standard for this type of workwear. I use them for projects around the house and garage, working on my Jeep and motorcycles, and snow shoveling in the winter.

AS FOR SIZING!!! These are very different than your average pair of jeans. In regular jeans I'm either a 34 or 36 waist, with 30 length. For these overalls, I wear a 40x32!! Yeah, really! And it's not baggy in the waist at all. Especially if you wear jeans underneath. So, I'd recommend at LEAST 2 sizes bigger in the waist, plus one size bigger in length. Heck i'd probably be happy wearing a 42x32, especially with a hoodie underneath.

Some sizes I wear in other brands--
American eagle jeans- 34x30
Levi jeans- 34x30
Dockers pants- 36x30
Fox Motocross pants- 36

So again, buy bigger than normal here!!

Sizing aside, you can't go wrong with these overalls. They are super thick and tough, almost like a canvas material. Plus they look awesome. They also have a zipper fly which is really convenient, along with buttons on the side to make it easier to slide them on. Plenty of pockets and a carpenters loop. Definitely a 5 star product!

For years I heard how good carhartt fit and how good they felt. 5 years back I bought my first pairs of loose fit jeans. I've been sold every since, I've bought hats, jackets and more britches. My first pairs (5 y/o)  are just now showing wear around the tops of the pocket openings.
I used to wear Liberty bibs, but you had to be so careful or they'd  shrink when washing. I tried dickies bibs, the fit was OK except for squatting down or sitting and standing up. They rode up my Crack and I'd be pulling my boxers out of my crack.
These bibs have turned out to be like my other carhartts, real comfortable. I wear a 42 W in the jeans, they're  a little loose. I'm 6'2 with long legs and a short torso. My gut is 48"". I went with 34 L x 48 W. Plenty of room. Feels great.
My only gripe is the hooks, they look cheap. Because of my short torso I had to work on the shoulder straps, I had to go past where the thinner strap meets the thicker material. I ended up using needle nose pliers to pull the buckle down to get the thicker material past it. Once I did that no problem. My 4 stars are for the cheaper hooks.
One other note, duck is heavy and shrinks. My 1st wash I put in bleach and thick rock salt (food grade). I wash 2 cycles with cold water. The salt helps soften the heavy fabric and bleach takes out the heavy dye. The wash water turned brown. Then to the dryer on low heat and air dry.

Is getting your regular pant size too small? Should you buy one size up in your waist, or two sizes up and one size longer? So here's to the point: The sizing on these Carhartt overalls is the same exact sizing as your Carhartt Dungarees or other Carhartt branded pants (in other words: it's exact sizing, it just arrives in the mail slightly larger because the cotton needs to be washed warm to shrink down to what you ordered). So the only thing is, you need to be mindful of what those numbers (36x32, 40x30, etc.) actually stand for. The ""waist"" size stands not only for the distance around your waist (circumference), but also for the girth all the way up to the straps (around your torso). So if you like your overalls tighter/looser than your regular pants, get your ""waist"" size accordingly. The inseam length is pretty typical and self-explanetory---it measures the distance from your waist all the way down the legs (take into consideration whether you'll be wearing high boots, low sneakers, be on your knees a lot, etc.).

The fit is different- they are less loose through the midsection (or perhaps, ahem, da hubs has overindulged a bit on those cookies, but I'll never tell him that!), and have a different fit through the hips. They also have narrower legs, which is a big plus. The fabric is sturdy, and a little coarser, but not rough- they're quite comfortable. The one downside that we've discovered is that these pretty much *have* to be taken out of the dryer immediately, or they crinkle- but that's the nature of the fabric. Other than that incredibly tiny issue, they're wonderful, and if anything, fit my fella better than the stonewashed ones (and we both looooove those stonewashed ones!).

Here is the Carhartt Sizing instruction for coverall:

1) CHEST MESURMENT; Measure in inches just under arms and across shoulder blades holding the tape firm and level.

2) MUST BE EVEN NUMBER: If your measurement is an odd number or in between size: GO UP to the next EVEN size.

EXAMPLE:
Chest measuring tape size is 39 = your number is 40,
Chest measuring tape size is 38.5 = your number is 40,
Chest measuring tape size is 40 your number is 40.

3) ADD + 4 TO YOUR NUMBER IF WORN ALONE
ADD + 6 TO NUMBER IF WORN OVER OTHER CLOTHES

Ex: your number is 38, buy size 42, if worn alone [38+4],
Or buy size 44 if worn over other clothing [38+6].

FOR LENGHT:

BUY SHORT if your height is: 53 to 57
BUY REGULAR if your height is: 57 to 511
BUY TALL if your height is: 511 to 63

This is the precise Carhartt measurement for a proper fit. Coverall does not have a waistline and are measured by chest size as mentioned above.

I mistakenly ordered a too-large set to start with- I took the advice of (apparently male) other reviewers, and ordered larger than my waist and inseam measurements. They didn't fit. I swam about in them for a minute or two, but was immediately impressed with the quality of the fabric, stitching, and overall (pardon the pun) design. I'm usually a 32-34/34 in jeans, but in these, a 36/34 was waaaay too large. On a whim, my husband asked to try them on, and they were long, even on him- and he's 6'1 / 210 lbs.- but he immediately fell in love with them. (And they actually look pretty hot on him- can't say that about most overalls on most men.) This was actually fortunate, as it gave me a better idea of what size to order for myself (and saved me from the Valentine's Day conundrum, LOL!) So now I have my own pair as well, and I gotta say, they're just wonderful- the color is darker than pictured, but I like that. The details are nicely done, the pockets are a delight (and I keep finding MORE of 'em all the time), they're well-put-together, comfortable, and well....they're just GREAT. The legs are a little long, but I don't care- better too long than too short. I wound up getting a pair in 34/32, and that's working out nicely for me- room enough to layer shirts if needs be, but definitely cute with a smaller, non-bulky top.

A special note to other female buyers: the other terrific thing about these is that the bib is wide enough to accomodate a woman's chest, without that weird, uh, centering/not centering thing that happens with overalls that AREN'T wide enough up top- no ""peek-a-boob"" effect, which is my major gripe with the makers of many ""ladies'"" overalls. (I mean, why on earth would you skimp on the bib fabric, for a clientele with breasts? I mean, REALLY?!) And if your fella has the classic suit-wearing physique, broad-shouldered and narrow-hipped, he will look GREAT in a set of these, no joke! (Got a ""Jethro"" fantasy, ala Beverly Hillbillies? I didn't, either. Until I got my husband a pair of these. *Giggle*)

 These are comfortable, well-made, high-quality overalls, and the price is right- much nicer than other brands that I could mention, and have wasted money on in the past.

While the shirt looks great - it is thick and seems cosy and like a great staple for winter wardrobe, it is ENORMOUS!  My husband wears a Large in most t-shirts - Quiksilver, O'Neill, Hurley, Target.  I ordered the Large size and it looked like two of the Large shirts from the other brands could be made from the amount of fabric used for one Carhartt Large.  VERY VERY WIDE.  So, I ordered the Medium thinking that would be better.  It is still WAY too wide - about a size larger than the long sleeve Quiksilver shirt that arrived at the same time.  They are out of stock on the small sizes in the colors that I want, but based on the sizing of the Large and the Medium shirts, I would say the Small is equivalent to a Large in other brands.  My suggestion; order more than one size and see which fits.  The shirt is cut very wide in the torso.

I would say their sizing is:

Carhartt Large = XXL (other brands)

I would go even further and suggest maybe even order down TWO sizes.

My size is technically a XL reg, which for most shirts, fits me just right.  So I ordered an XL for this shirt... what I got was labeled as an XL regular but fit like it was a XXXL tall, it was ginormous!  To say I was swimming in the shirt would be an understatement.

Being this is Amazon with their awesome services, I quickly went online and initiated an exchange for a Large. I got my large shirt, and I am happy to say it is a decent enough fit, still a tad big, but I'm sure a run through the wash will take care of that.

So yeah, this is no joke or understatement, order a size down!  Also for reference, the shirts I got were made in Mexico.

As for the quality of the shirt, it is top notch!  Nice and thick and feels like it will last a lifetime.  Most shirts you get nowadays are thin (practically see-through), weak and barely last a month because of companies skimping out on materials to save a few $$, but no expense is spared with this shirt, and you definitely get what you paid for.  Also this shirt is pretty long, more so than I personally like but it would be ideal for tucking in.  And since it is plenty long, if you go untucked you can rest assure that you won't be getting any wise-cracks every time you bend down to pick something up.

EDIT 1/10/12:  I am dropping my star rating to 2.  As I mentioned above the sizing for these shirts is massive, but I liked my large charcoal shirt so much I decided to get a lighter colored one, in the Ash color.  Since I was reasonably assured by ordering the same size shirt I got last time (a large which fit me pretty nicely), I ordered another large thinking it would be of consistent sizing.

Sadly in this case even the large was WAY too big, in fact it is about 3 inches longer than my other large, and it is also much wider as well.  It is not a tall version, the tags and everything on the packaging and shirt say Large, Reg.  This is absolutely ridiculous to have this much difference in sizing.  This shirt is big enough to be considered a XXL tall by most standards.

For the record, this Ash color is made in Haiti (at least mine was), whereas my other large Charcoal color was made in Mexico.  So perhaps if I got a ash colored shirt made in Mexico a large would have fit me consistency with my other shirt, but since we have absolutely no idea what shirt is made where and which one we could get, I feel the inconsistent sizing and standards of these Carhartt shirts is beyond unacceptable.  It is sad to think a company like Carhartt is becoming so unreliable, it is getting so hard to find decent/reliable products nowadays and this situation has only soured me even more.

Since there is free return shipping I am sending the overly big large back and am going to try my luck on a Medium sized Ash shirt.  I will edit my review with my findings when it arrives.

EDIT 1/13/12: My new replacement medium shirt came in yesterday.  It was also made in Haiti.  The length of the shirt is identical to the large (it is extremely long for a medium, way too long) but its side-to-side sizing is definitely smaller, almost too small for me (which will shrink even more when I wash it).

Overall the sizing variance is highly unacceptable and I am keeping my star rating to 2.  And while I really like these shirts in terms of thickness and look, I am not sure I will dare try to order another color as the sizing may vary as wildly as the sizing between the ash and charcoal colors.

Upon receipt the metal shaft of one of the trees was bent and the mechanism wouldn't function properly until I bent it back straight so it would work.

I figured out how to set some things just by pushing various buttons. But this has really been aggravating. The sheet that comes with the watch just tells to go to a jeweler to change the battery and not to go in deep water with the watch or press buttons while in water. There is no information on how to set anything on the watch!

I updated the review once, but Amazon didn't update my review because I put a URL in there pointing to a PDF file that contained instructions for operating this watch. This information on how to operate the watch is needed by a lot of people who bought this watch.

I emailed Amazon to find out what was wrong and I got a disgusting answer that my review was rejected because of the URL contained in the review. Then Amazon apparently deleted the review altogether.

Later on found a way to convert the PDF file to a JPG file that I uploaded to Amazon. However, the upload at Amazon changed the quality of the JPG file so that it was unreadable. My apologies to anyone who tried to read the JPG file. I deleted the review to get rid of the JPG file.

Anyway, there were no instructions with the watch except a paper in several languages telling me to take the watch to a jeweler for a new battery and that the watch is not for use in deep water and not to press buttons on the watch when in water. There were absolutely no instructions as to how to set time, date, alarm, etc.

My wrist is 7 1/4"". One customer responded to my question about watch band size by saying that he also had a 7 1/4"" wrist and that he ""could use a little more"", probably meaning that the band was a little tight on him. This is exactly the case with me. The band might not be tight enough to cause trouble, but I'm testing that now. I've found that the watch leaves a fairly deep impression in the skin on my wrist after wearing it awhile. Some parts of the impression were red and the impression stayed there for a fairly long time after I removed the watch. The band also has a slight tendency to pinch or grab the skin when putting the watch on.

The buttons on the Timex are very small and require a lot of pressure to press. You're going to get sore fingers pressing those buttons!

I figured out a way to get instructions to everyone on here who needs them. I found a good PDF file that shows instructions for this watch. I loaded the PDF file into Adobe Reader and then copied and pasted information to a text file. Here are the instructions that I copied and pasted from the PDF file. By the way, the PDF file appears to be a scan of the original Timex instruction sheet.

Here are the instructions:

Update: Today is 8/26/2017. I sent an email to Timex asking about instructions for this watch on 8/12/2017 and never got an answer. It shouldn't take 2 weeks to get a reply from a decent company, especially when someone is asking for instructions for one of their products.

Since I was able to find instructions for this watch after a very hard search (and posted those instructions above), I will try to keep the watch. But I'm not going to increase my 1 start rating because of the lack of instructions and lack of response from Timex. I don't think much of Timex.

No not a Timex and no longer made. But it's definitely preformed beyond the imagination. Problem is hindsight is 20/20 and we should have bought 1-2 spares for the day. That day is coming sooner than the person who wears the watch is ready for. So have been watching ditital display style watches over the past 15 years and they all fall way short of the original style. This one comes in as close as you can. Most of the digital men's watches are fat heavy way to big and thick SPORT fashion. The makers of these watches are missing the boat by not bringing back a few designs along this line where the face and case is thinner and teh whole watch is simple but has the essentials such as backlight, Easy to read time and date. SImple to manage and replace the batteries. And a watch face that is clear and replaceble over time when it may get scratched or cloudy. So this was bought as a stocking stuffer spare. BUT and a BIG BUTT...the so called mini manual that was inserted gave ZERO directions as to how to set the watch. We went over it multiple times and finally with on way to contact the seller we did track down via google search a Timex person who provided us with the information needed. Thank you person who e-mailed both how to do the basics so as not to make the person wait and followed up with e-mail attachment where to go for it and we've since downloaded and printed it out and it is with the watch in waiting. I would include that information but unfortunately I forwarded to the other persons computer and after they printed it they deleted it. Yeah...a guy thing verses woman thing that looks at a bigger picture and likes to help others. So google for Timex manuals and sort through the debri listings until you find one where you can then ask for help when you find this watch is listed but with no further information. Only one star off due to the lame manual. Timex should know better. and that includes all the different languages tucked into the tiny folded bit of ultra thin paper. No matter the language we all need the basic's that out to arrive with the watch. This review in now way is about the seller here on Amazon they shipped fast and watch was protected and in good condition. My only one star delete is lack of information and annoyance of NEEDING to track it down. Kudos again to the person who got right to it and the other buyer who attempted to fill in those blanks too via the Q/A section.

Not only is this watch cute (he gets tons of complements from his friends about it), but it wasn't expensive (under $30). And this watch doesn't look cheap or flashy.

I have some Casio retro digitals and I also have several Timex Ironman models, all of which are nice. But this watch was atrocious. The first thing I noticed removing it from the box was that the LCD display was significantly out of alignment with the case. I guess I'm kind of anal about that, but it immediately made me want to return the watch, on that flaw alone. But there was more. The band was pretty flimsy feeling, unlike the Casio counterpart, which has a much sturdier and nicer looking band. Furthermore, the band was borderline too small. My wrists are medium and this band claimed to be large and should fit with plenty of room, but it didn't. And lastly, the product description claims this model has a chrono, alarm and a timer, but it does not have a timer. At least the version I received did not. Maybe they sent a similar model, but not the exact one. In any case, all these flaws made returning it an easy decision. I'm sticking with the nicer, cheaper and tougher Casio version (Casio Men's A178WA-1A), which is only $13.99.

I bought them in size 16 plus which is the size I
use at Lane Bryant and Macy's.
At the same time I bought  these exact same pants in
dark blue and regular denim color
in size 18 Average and they fit perfectly.
The interesting thing is that I never had
Gloria Vanderbilt jeans before and I never fit into
size 18 from any other designer.
Maybe I did not calculate the sizes correctly
I thought that:  If 18 Average fits
than size  16 Plus has to fit better as it is listed
as 1/2 inch wider.
Well, it was a lot smaller in the hips and waist.
BUT THEN  I bought size 18 Average in black
and AGAIN they were too small.
Then I looked at the fabric and maybe that explains it

BUT, the fabric is standard commercial, NOT the rip-stop/banded cloth used in field BDU's: at least, not the ones I'm familiar with.  Nonetheless, they fit as expected according to their sizing chart, and the outward design matches the field BDU's of old.

I am a ""pockets"" kind of fellow who feels lost without lots of places to store things.  This design is what I need for everyday wear.  As with GI clothing when you first get them, there are LOTS of ropes (threads) hanging.  Make sure to go over both the inside and the outside of the garment to burn them down BEFORE washing.  After the first wash, go over it again and burn any other loose ones.  Pay special attention to the stitching along the pockets inside and the buttons.  This will save you a lot of trouble later and extend the life of the garment.

As far as sizing, it is as advertised.  I'm 6'2"", 220 lbs, with a 39"" waist and a 32"" inseam.  I got the XL size, and they're perfect, the side straps take in any looseness.  The inseam on them is 33"", but with boots/shoes on, they wear just right without dragging.","Authentic Design, Commercial Cloth",1385164800,

The fabric is pretty thin so we decided he had to wear jeans underneath the blue pants, so that it was more appropriate for children to see him in. Haha.

The mask was awesome. Half star off because it had a slight scratch on the nose where the blue rubbed off into white, probably the size of a dime. No one noticed, except me.

I take mine off at night and when I take showers or swim.

I read the reviews of this chain and decided to take a chance (since the other 2 chains were good quality and the seller seemed very trustworthy). The balls are small but they are 2mm as listed so I was not surprised or disappointed in the size at all. They are just as thick, if not thicker, than the two 2mm snake chains I ordered.

This necklace is so lovely and of such high quality; I was so pleased to receive it. It is shinier and more beautiful than the picture! Note the lobster clasp, which is very sturdy and pretty as well.

Since the vendor does not list it as ""nickel free"" I researched it on the Internet and found that apparently .925 sterling silver is always nickel free; I am mentioning this in case you are like me and were wondering about this because of allergies.

The vendor ships very, very quickly (I had my item within 4 days) and for the price, I found everything about this necklace to be superb. I would have gladly paid twice the cost for it.

Highly recommended.

  On day 3 I went to the hardware store and when I took my seat belt off in the car, the left suspender front fastener flew apart. I found the two pieces and by looking at the good fastener was able to tell how to put it back together, but it would not stay together
as the upper tooth part would slide out of the holes.  I went home and got my vice grips out and bent the holder closer together and all has been well so far.  I think the seat belt may have hung slightly on the suspender fastener and twisted it a bit causing to spread and come apart.  You will have to look at the fasteners for this to make any sense to you, I am sure.
  Now, if this metal is strong enough, it should not bend from such a slight tug and all will be well. If the metal is weak it will spread
and come apart again.  Only time will tell. If it had not been for this, I would have given it a 5.  If all goes well I will revise review.

I want to say, that these suspenders have served me well through the summer gardening and yard work. Though they are showing a small bit of wear, they keep my pants up and do not let go. They have not come apart as they did on one occasions earlier. I look forward to another summer of wearing them when I work.

Update 10/15/14 -- These are now the footwear I choose whenever I know I'm going to be walking a lot and need to be comfortable, but still want to be stylish. Example: I went to Alcatraz this past weekend, where I walked all over, up and down hills, on uneven ground, for hours. At the end of the day, I was exhausted, but my feet were still good.

I wear between an 8.5 and a 9 --- always a 9 in boots (dress boots these are my first western boots). I'm given to understand a properly fitting new boot should make a slight popping sound when you put your heel in it, should fit firmly in the instep, and not allow rocking in the toes, and a tiny bit of heel slippage. Only one heel made the required pop when I put these on and so I believe they may a little too big. I thought about it a good deal before I decided if I went any smaller they may simply be too tight. And that's when I began to wear them.

The leather was exceptionally stiff near the ankles the first 3-4 times I wore these and they were marginally uncomfortable during break-in. After a week of wear they're comfortable as sneaker and I'm wearing them all around town even though it's still hot out. The insole is breathable and well cushioned for impact.

Right out of the box I put them on and walked several miles in them.  The weather has been rather wet for a month or more, and I was concerned that the leathers soles on my Lama's would expedite the deteriorization and force me to have them half soled later in the year.  At first I thought these were a little larger than I had planned on, although they were very comfortable brand new.  The rubber (?) soles and heals somehow made them feel very similar to the slip on walking shoes I've work in the past.  My immediate concern about size quickly disappeared.  They are the perfect size and exactly what I wanted.  10 1/2 EE and now that they are a week old and I wear them constantly during the day, I've found them to be as comfortable as my walking shoes.
As I've done in the past, I always put rubber taps (ordered from Amazon) on the heels to guard against my heals getting worn down and forcing me to the expense of rehealing.
Bottom line; these are great boots, their comfortable, they will hold up for what will be an extended time without resoling and rehealing, and I'll very likely be ordering another pair in a few months.  They are clean looking boots and I'm sure will be easy to polish and visually give me that western look I strive for.

My first pair lasted almost 10 years of nearly every day wear (and they still looked very good). One of the biggest reasons I wanted to update my boots was because my wife got a pair of Ariats a year or two ago and they had made significant improvements since I bought my boots. The biggest change from my last boots to these is the tread on the bottom. My first boots were very slick on snow and even worse on wet linoleum flooring. I almost fell several times after being out in the rain. The new boots are very, very grippy. They have also upgraded the arch support. Otherwise they seem to be the same great quality and fit as my old boots.

Most Ariats don't have the traditional J-toe cowboys wore, but they have a decent R-toe. The R-toe still gives somewhat of a pointed look for your feet, but doesn't make the boot too bulky like some other Toe Styles. I was looking at these and a few other brands. What really separated these out were I was able to buy them for $144 with no tax at a local Saddle Shop in NJ because there is no tax on clothes and they had a 20% off sale. The other thing is the bottom soles are rubber and not leather. Rubber holds up better if it rains, where as leather typically does not. Thus in turn I didn't want to have to get my boots resoled all the time. That's an advantage to these. Something to keep in mind.

Pros
- Cushioning is comfortable. I danced for 6 hours the other night and no issues because my foot was at an incline all night. No knee pain with a good boot.
- Rubber Bottoms
- Leather Outs.

The only other thing is sizing. I measured my foot at the saddle shop and most shoes I wear I am a size 11. I was a comfortable size 10.5 in these. Both fit well, but the 10.5 was a snug comfortable fit.",These Boots were Made for a Lot,1447977600,

The last two pairs have lasted me for three years each.  Before I started wearing these boots, I was going through a pair of shoes about every six months.  The main thing that's great about these boots over regular cowboy boots is the heel.  The heel on these boots looks more like a normal shoe.  Usually, cowboy boots have a higher and narrower heel.  One complication with a higher heel is that all of your pants end up looking short and a bit ridiculous.  With the normal heel on these boots, you can wear these boots without having to get special pants.  The boots can be a bit warm on hot sunny days, but I've gotten in the habit of adding a bit of foot powder in the mornings and haven't had any issues.

If I have one issue, it's that they changed the name of the boot styles since I bought my last pair three years ago.

The Justins sport a lower heel and a smooth flexible leather sole making them a slightly more comfortable but not especially long wearing (probably better for dancing though).

So he decided to get 2 different types of pants, the Loose Fit Cargo and the Relaxed Fit Cargo.  The Loose Fit Cargo is slightly too loose for him and the material is not what he's used to.  The material collects every piece of lint and dog fur and is easily wrinkled.  However, the Relaxed Fit Cargo fits nicely on him and is a more Dickies-like material that he is used to.  So from now on, he will continue to purchase the Relaxed Fit instead of Loose Fit.  Thank you.",Dickies has always been best about making good quality,1513209600,

Almost every military in the world issues them.  There are many high-quality commercial brands (including the ones sold here).  But whatever the maker/origin, they are one of the most practical and useful items to have in your kit, IMHO.

I was just thinking about this as the rainy season just started here and I attached my ""rain/cold weather"" MOLLE pouch to my belt.  My belt pouch module (6"" X 6"" X 3"") contains my rain poncho, an emergency bivy sack, a Nomex hood (which rolls up like a watch cap), and a chemical hand-warmer packet.  These items added to what I already carry everyday, make me prepared for inclement weather or even an unscheduled night out in the elements.

A poncho is not much more than a large piece of water-proof cloth (or vinyl) with a headhole that allows it to be worn, completely covering the front and back of the body (including equipment and pack).  The technology dates back to the American Civil War when Union soldiers were issued ""Gum Blankets"" which were pieces of canvas coated with a rubber mixture (made by ""Goodyear"" believe it or not!).  It is very effective as raingear.  Ah!  but a poncho can be so much more.

Though not the most effective at this function, a poncho is a rudimentary (minimally insulative) blanket.  When used in combination with a quilted poncho liner, it becomes a very effective blanket.

When laid out on the ground, it's a nice waterproof ground cloth.  Basically like any tarpaulin.

When snapped into a tube, it forms a simple sleeping bag.

This same tube makes a field expedient body bag.

In Ranger School, they teach a technique by which two ponchos can be sealed together to make a pontoon float that can buoy two full rucksacks.

A poncho is very effective for smoke signalling (trapping and accumulating smoke).

When suspended or supported overhead, it makes a good shelter (or tent).  It can also protect (shelter) individual objects sensitive to moisture.

This same shelter idea can be used to collect water (rain) in a survival situation, channeling into a basin or canteen.

Similarly, it can be hung up as a wind/sun shelter or blind to conceal something.

It's wind catching ability can be capitalized on to form a sail, if lost at sea or on open water.

The technique is not easily explained (in text), but a poncho (and many sticks) can be used to make an effective ""fish trap"" in a survival situation.

Like any large piece of cloth, it can be an emergency catch blanket for someone to jump down into from a height.

Like any large piece of cloth, it can be a drag sled or litter (for dragging game, or tranporting an injured person).

Similarly, it can be used to carry large, heavy loads of anything (firewood, dirt, stones, ammo, forage).

If rolled, folded correctly, it can carry several gallons of water in one load for short distances.

Although I wouldn't trust my weight on it as a ""hammock"", I have personally used a poncho along with rope and paracord to help hold/haul loads up into a tree blind and to suspend food away from bears and critters.

With tent poles or any flexible ""poles"" of sufficient length, one can make an Alpha Tent (low dome personal bivy)out of a poncho by putting the end of the tent poles through the opposite (not adjacent) corner grommets of the poncho.

Looking at Native American ""shirts"" in museums, one can see that the poncho idea (a headhole through an animal skin) is the basis for much early clothing.  One of the great things about a poncho as clothing is that it can be easily improvised (like in Rambo: First Blood).  A rectangular piece of cloth, headhole and some rope to belt it off.  And anything waterproof, like a trash can liner, upholstery, animal skin or tarp, can become poncho for raingear.

Similar to the clothing concept, the poncho forms a basic cape, and if the poncho is camofluaged or matches the environmental colours, it makes a decent ""mobile"" sniper veil.  This variant type of poncho is actually an issue item in Eastern Bloc armies.

I know this is silly, but once, I had occasion to use my grey poncho as a field expedient slide projector screen out in the jungle.

I'm sure there are many more functions for a poncho, but I'll leave it at that for now.  Bottomline is, with all the very useful, potentially life-saving uses of this simple device, I think it's an excellent investment for anyone's ""Emergency Preparedness Kit"".  So why not add one?",One of the most Versatile Items you can own,1232150400,

01/11/17  I down graded my review today after wearing the boots outside to plow snow on my driveway.  Sitting on my open cab tractor plowing snow for over an hour in 8 degree weather  yielded cold feet wearing these boots with wool socks on.  Getting off the tractor to walk on the snow was EXTREMELY treacherous.  Though the boots have lugs on the bottom of them, the man made sole is very slippery on snow.  I also want to note that the sole gets rock hard outside in the cold weather and does not remain pliable.  These boots are the most light weight and comfortable boots I have ever worn but I cannot recommend them for working outside in cold weather.  Had I known before hand how poor their insulating properties were and their slipperiness on snow, I would not have bought them.  I will now have to relegate them to wearing outside in summer weather on dry ground.  Do NOT buy these if you are looking for a cold weather boot. They responded with an email to me saying that these boots have a base insulation but are NOT MEANT for extreme cold.  They made a recommendation that I try their Arctic Grip boots which have a minimum of 400 grams of Thinsuliate  and  have a sole designed for maximum

I have been wearing these Canadian boots for over a month now, in the hottest heat of the summer. It seems that Thinsulate keeps out the heat and adds padding, making these the most incredibly comfortable boots in the whole wide world. The leather is softer than what is used on the Rain Forest Brown, and break-in was minimal. The Danner Bob sole is absolutely amazing for soft uneven surfaces, but be aware that the soft rubber knobs will mark up a hard floor. The insulation might bunch up a little during break in, so be sure to reach inside the boot after wearing them and smooth the Thinsulate back into place. Once the leather and padding molds into the shape of your foot and calf, this won't likely be a problem but make sure to mind the creasing during the first month of wear to avoid pinch points. Same goes with the tongue, maybe use a shoehorn down the calf lacing to make sure the leather doesn't bunch up as you lace them. I would suggest ordering the Boot Dressing with these boots to help soften the tongue during break-in. So if you need a gorgeous, dark brown, rugged yet comfortable tall boot that will be almost exclusively worn outside in rough terrain, this is the boot for you.

Certainly Danner's are not for everyone, just like a differnt motorcycle helmet manufacturers different brands fit different people. Danner's are narrow by design, and do tend to run a bit on the flat side in the arch.  But if they do fit your foot shape, you will never go back to anything else.

Acadia's are worn by most of the people who are out there protecting you every day.  Fire, police, and military personnel are the people who these boots, and in that task they meet all the requirements those professions demand. I've worn the Acadia since 1996 on my job as a professional firefighter/EMT and though I've tried a few other kinds of boots over the years; I always come back to the Acadia.  These boots have seen me through 200 degree ground on wildland fires ( NOTE- these do not meet current wildland specs any longer - boots must be full leather)HAZMAT incidents, and more muddy ditches on motor vehicle accident's than I can count.

Are these boots more expensive than a cheap pair of ""tactical"" boots? Yes, but with a pair of Danner boots you get the ability to have them reconditioned, as well as owning a boot that will outlast almost any other on the market, and they are made in the USA in Portland, Oregon.

You will not be disappointed.  I've had these boots for about three months now and I absolutely love them.  Here is my experience with them.

Prior to buying the Acadia boot, I was wearing the Danner Kinetic GTX boot in size 11.5.  Using my superb observation skills, I determined that I should probably order the same size in the Acadia boots because my Kinetic GTX boots fit really well.  However, what I did not account for was extra width to accommodate my custom orthotic (for plantar fasciitis).  These boots do not come with a removable insole, therefore you need to order one size wider than what you'd usually wear to account for the space taken up by the orthotic.  An 11.5 2E allowed me to use my custom orthotic insert, yet still felt absolutely perfect from a comfort and fit standpoint.  If you are one of those people who do not need any support inside of your boot, I'd still recommend wearing these boots in one size wider than what you'd normally wear, unless you like very snug boots.

These boots took me between one and two months to break in for full comfort.  In addition to just wearing them to break them in, I used Obenauf's Heavy Duty LP (Leather Protectant) to help soften and protect the leather.  The leather on my boots not only feels soft, but I've noticed the leather is more flexible.

So far, I've used these boots in cooler weather, warmer weather, and wet conditions.  I've had no issues at all.  I'm about to embark on an Arizona summer in these and I'll update this review based upon how the boots felt in extreme heat.  Overall though, I feel like these boots would protect my feet from just about anything I'd come across while at work.

These boots are not designed for running, however.  The couple of times I've had to run in them, they feel clunky and heavy.  That being said, I have yet to feel exhausted in these boots while wearing them for periods of 10-16 hours at a time.

Other boots I considered getting instead of these boots included: Danner Kinetic GTX (yes, a second pair because they were comfortable), Bates Durashocks, Rocky Paraboots, and Under Armour Stellar and Valstetz boots. When it came down to it, I chose the Acadia boots based upon the highly positive reviews, their ability to be resoled, their durability, and their comfort.  Not that the other boots were bad, but each of them had one or more aspects of their boots which could not match the Acadia's reputation.",Stop debating and just buy them!

These boots are not quite as comfortable and I have had more frequent issues with plantar fasciitis pain with this boot with or without the included insert than with other boots, but a custom made orthotic (or daily stretching if you KNOW you have this problem) should remedy this for anyone.

After over a year of continuous use, the Vibram soles show extremely little signs of any wear, only a very slight rounding at the heel is the only indication that they have seen any use at all.

Though the boots are quite heavy and so sturdy, the soles make them surprisingly quiet. It is very easy to walk nearly silently on any debris-free surface.

The Gortex works absolute wonders. I took these boots out to the California coast and spent several hours with my feet submerged with absolutely no water leakage. Obviously you want to make sure the leather properly dries out after getting soaked though.

The leather polishes up to a great shine. The hinge point of your toes is a little tricky to keep polished compared to your standard Air Force low quarters, but overall they shine great.

The sizing is a little on the large side, my 11.5 US size with thick Thorlo combat socks still has enough gap to cause my heels to get blistered over several miles of walking so I would encourage potential buyers to try them on first before buying. Silk liners may be all you need to insert if you run into this problem though.

The heal and arch were loose on my feet. But the toe box was snug. So I got some Dr Scholls insoles. They helped, but made the toe box even more snug. So I may try the fitted arch support that dr Scholls sells, as it will give more room in the toe. The size length wise was spot on. I were 10 1/2, and it was the right size for me.  I might should have returned my wides for a regular width. But that may have made the toe box too snug. So I kept them. And Danner, come on!!! No insoles in a 250.00 boot???!!!! Really???? And NO the boots aren't comfortable without buying some insoles. The plastic airthotics that come with the boots are junk in my opinion. They were uncomfortable. So they got replaced.

So I ordered three packages of Jockey's Elance French Cut Underwear, just as I did last Christmas. I received my underwear and opened it and found what can only be described as GIRL's sized underwear! In fact, last year's size six is two inches SMALLER than this year's. What the beans? I called Jockey and was told to order one size up. Huh? I've lost 22 pounds since I last purchased this underwear. One would think I'd need to order a smaller size. Nope. I wear a 6. Jockey swears a 7 will be the same as last year's 6.  We'll see...

CONS
1) Way smaller than previous year's cut. We're talking two inches smaller
2) If you wear a size 6, and it's perfect, order AT LEAST a size seven.
3) If you wear a size 7 -- a very common size -- order an 8, which, by the way, is often more expensive. Not cool.

PROS:
Customer Service is nice at Jockey.  They're used to hearing that their women's underwear is now WAY SMALL.  They say that the brand insists the sizing is the same; but they know better.

Jockey used to be an awesome brand. Its sizing remained constant for about twenty years.  Jockey used to be what women who are a healthy weight purchased, because it was sized properly.

However, this pair I've bought in the last year has not been as good quality as my older size 6 (that are now too small).  I only wore them a few times because they made my right heel hurt so bad that I had a hard time walking the next day.  I wore them today and figured out why they hurt my feet now, when the older pair did not; the newer pair failed structurally.  The right heel padding is pulling away from the shoe and the padding underneath has all but disintegrated, leaving me walking on the rim of the sole.  Either I got a shoe made on Friday at 1730, or Easy Spirit is no longer producing quality shoes.  I hope it's the former.  For now, I have managed to make these shoes wearable (several layers of moleskin tucked up under the heel's foot-bed seems to have helped).

I originally bought two of these bras (or at least I thought they were the same exact bras, only they did not have a different color lining) and they were great. I bought another in black with beige lining which fit just as great when I tried it on. However, once I washed it, it emitted a horrible ""Playdoh clay"" smell. At first first, I could not figure out what the smell was and wandered all over the laundry room trying to sniff around to determine the source, then discovered it was coming from the bra. I washed the bra 2 more times and still, the same nasty odor. I let it dry, hoping the smell would diminish, which it did.... slightly but all I could smell as I walk through the house was a nasty, clay smell. I immediately removed the bra, and now it is trash because I missed the return cutoff by a week.

I cannot imagine what type of chemical they use in the molded foam bra cups that would smell so awful but I will never purchase this bra again!

A note of explanation:  I consider myself a very ""international"" person, very multi-cultural in interest and education.  Many of my closest friends come from other countries, and I often joke that I practice reverse discrimination.  I was a foreign language major from a name school, with a graduate degree decades later in ethnic-American lit from an Ivy.  I LOVE well-made things from interesting places.  But made in modern-day China does not seem to qualify, at least in the ""well made"" category.

Yes, I am probably keeping these Scout sandals.  They are basically the same shoe as my beloved Scout sandals made by that same firm some decades back, which I have periodically replaced, noting changes in fit, softness of leather (or lack thereof), and overall look.  They have gone from dainty and almost glove-like leather some 30 years ago, to more cumbersome and stiffer some decades back.  These, however, are positively cloddy looking and the so-called ""leather upper"" seems to be a thin layer attached to vinyl or, worse yet, plastic.  The style is the same, the brand the same, but the origination, materials, and even fit (thanks to varying shoe lasts) are far different.

All that being said, where in the world can I find traditional shoes in a 7 Narrow?  Our beloved bargain chain, Building 19, used to carry small narrows (as well as every other size variant), but just closed their doors forever.  So I am stuck.  These will serve.  They are a tad wider than the former  Naturalizer Scout narrows., but they are wearable.  I have others that are slightly better, purchased in previous years as extras.  These will be tucked away, farther back, until I am out of options.  The Naturalizer and also the Easy Spirit outlets-- not too far from us-- used to carry my size.  Now it's rare, the costs silly, and the styles unsuitable for someone mid-60's who really doesn't want to change with the times.  So...a big THANK YOU to Bealls of Florida, still carrying my TYPE products.  A big vote of ""NO!"" for Chinese manufacture as it is now practiced.  My assumption is that Communism, followed probably by greed, has changed the wonderful artisan look of Asian goods from China of eons gone by.  But I will do what I must not to become ""descalzada,"" like shoeless religious of monasterial origin.

A post script:  To those of you with similarly small, narrow feet, do look at Walking Cradles, also available through Amazon.  Their flats are soft leather, heavenly comfortable, but not inexpensive.

They stretch to fit your feet, so don't buy a pair that fit slightly too big at the start--they should be a perfect or even slightly snug fit to start.

In regards to the fit, they are true to size in length, but a tad on the narrow side for the width, even when ordered in extra wide.  This is important to remember if you have a wider foot--you will not be able to ""get by"" without ordering them appropriately.

My husband initially complained that the arch support was a bit much, but after wearing them a few days, has said it feels better.  This could simply be that his previous shoes didn't offer support, so it just felt odd to get new ones that did.  His biggest complaint is that the shoes do not have sufficient room to add an insole, even a Dr. Scholl's Odoreater would be too much in this particular shoe.  There is some adjustment through the strap over the instep, which means it will fit high or low insteps reasonably well.  (His are about average.)

The purpose we bought these shoes for was to be used in lieu of slippers for wearing around the house and the occasional trip outside with the dogs.  Normal house slippers are hard to find in his size and usually fail to stay on his feet properly, instead becoming tripping hazards.

I usually wear a 7 1/2 W  shoe (I am a C width and the toe next to my big toe is the longest toe), and went down to a 7W in this style because the 7 1/2 W would slip off my heel and 7 1/2M was way too tight.  The 7XW has a bit more space in the ball of foot area, but they were so loose and would also slip off. These 7W were a bit tight in length to start but have comfortably stretched the tiny amount I needed to comfortably accommodate my foot (and it does not show an outline of my toes as some shoes do when they conform to the foot).

The EE width was fine but, because the interior height of the shoe at the strap was too generous, his foot tended to slide forward leaving too much space at the heel.  Pulling the Velcro strap down didn't reduce the volume enough to make it secure so we returned it.

In general, I think these were fine.  They looked good and were VERY light in weight.  The general construction looked good for this type of shoe.  It was also made in a way that should make it stable for most people (the sole is wider than the upper).

1) Stiff sole. Easily twice as stiff as the average running shoe.  Can withstand pretty rough terrain, on par with a hiking shoe. Great support.
2) Cushy insoles.  Provide soft feel without mushiness.
3) Versatile.  The styling of the grey color is muted enough to wear the shoe for pretty much anything, anywhere.  The trend today seems to be garish colors and eye catching style.  These have are understated and utilitarian while still looking good. The yellow on the outsole is not actually as bright as pictured.
4) Air flow - The material lets your foot breath freely. I like the fact that there is no waterproof layer in this model. Personally I despise Gore-Tex as it seems to trap moisture to the point your feet are soaked anyway.
5) Roomy toe box and nice width. I usually seek out W, E or EE, so buying D width usually doesn't work out.  My somewhat wide feet had no problems fitting into the Xodus 5.0.

I haven't tried them out on a trail yet but these are more comfortable than my underarmour shoes, and I've sworn by underarmour for the past 4 years.  I've worn these shoes off and on for about two weeks. I'll update the review after my first trail run, but so far here are the pros and cons:

Pro:
-These shoes fit true to size for me, not overly roomy and not too tight either.
-The insole is very soft, similar to the memory foam to underarmour shoes.
-The toe box is roomy without being TOO roomy, shouldn't have to worry about slipping.  For those of us with flatter arches/slightly wider feet this is a huge plus!!
-The tread is very aggressive, and looks like it will last.
-The mesh overlying the toe box has cross-stitching that looks similar to rip stop.  Should help with durability and the overall life of the shoe.
-The shoe is very breathable, and light, for those who will be training every day and often.
-Pricing--these shoes are very reasonably priced, especially on Amazon.

Con:
-Since the tread is so aggressive I wouldn't necessarily recommend for everyday wear, although they are comfortable enough to wear everyday.
-If you aren't used to Merrell shoes, or the underarmour shoes that have foam sock liners, you may find slight discomfort with the cushioning across the top portion of the toe box. For me they are comfortable, but I have some concerns with friction causing blister concerns on longer distance runs.

Overall I am extremely impressed with these shoes. Some of the other styles are very, very reasonable priced (30-40$) on Amazon.

The mesh body is breathable (I don't know how well it hold up against the MN winter). It is light-weight. The only down-side - it is a little bland, at least for me. I like a little color on my shoes. But it has nothing to do with what the shoes is actually made for - running.

Though I am really into running, I usually don't pay more than $50 for athletic shoes. A high-end shoes definitely has its plus points and all the serious runners I know of never crimp when shopping for shoes. What I do is different. I get a medium price shoes (or something on sale), get it half a size bigger and throw in some gel insoles depending upon the comfort level. I got a wide variety of gel insoles - heel, mid-soles, whole foot. You can get them for less than $10 from some auction sites.

Due to the ankle and a recurring dislocating hip that occasionally makes one leg slightly longer than the other, I have temporarily lost my natural gait.
I wanted shoes that were lightweight, and still offered some support and did not lift my feet 1.5 inches from the ground or force them into odd positions (toes significantly lower than heels).
Saucony meets my demands.

I wear mine to for daily activities and work (not much running yet). I also wear them for physical therapy and around the house for support and balance, something I never used to do. I love being barefoot and tended to resent shoes before I started wearing barefoot running shoes (and now Sauconys). But I never wore my Lems/Stems around the house 'just because'. I wear any of my 3 pairs of Sauconys in my house daily and I plan to buy more pairs. When I'm able, I will probably buy Lems again but do not plan to ever give up my Sauconys.

The Jazz Low Pro offers:
Low to the ground cushioning and support.
True to size fit.
Good sized toe box for natural feel.
A stay put fit without being too constricting.
Immediate comfort that is easy to slide into.
No need to break in.
Caused no foot, leg or back pain in a customer who is already susceptible.
Lightweight feel from toe to heel and sole to tongue.

My only disappointment is with the vegan version of the sneaker. I bought vegan only because it was a cheaper pair and I wanted black for my return to work.

The toe box seems slightly narrower than the suede/nylon version. This does not affect comfort for me, only visual appeal as the toe end looks slightly narrower than the center of the shoe.
The vegan version is just slightly stiffer but I anticipate no problems letting the canvas soften up a little more as I wear them.
The feel is not as smooth and soft -- easier to remember that you're wearing shoes (which I don't like).

Other than minor differences (not necessarily bad ones) in appearance and stiffness, the vegan version is comparable to the suede. Pay for the suede if your lifestyle allows. Worth it.

Several years ago we moved quite far from a Jockey store and I had to try other brands, none of which were close to the quality and fit of the old Jockey for Her briefs.  I was happy to find Jockey underwear on Amazon but since the picture, the name and the description were obviously different from the original briefs I used to wear I ordered only one package of 3 pairs of the Elance briefs.

Boy, am I glad I only ordered one package!  I am terribly disappointed that they do not fit comfortably at all.  When I got them out of the package the leg holes looked like they were too large and I think that is the problem. They are definitely not ""full coverage"" and I do not want part of my bum uncovered. At least the cotton knit is nice and soft.

Now I will have to try to find another package of the Lollipop brand cotton briefs I bought a year or so ago.  They fit perfectly - just like the Jockey brand used to do.  I will say that the Elance pants are not the worst underpants I have.  I bought a package of Hanes a while ago and they are much worse!

After receiving these underpants I did further research and found that what is described as ""PLUS size Classic briefs"" actually are available in the size 6 that I wear.......and that is not a ""PLUS"" size by any means.  If the description had not specified PLUS size I would have looked at those and ordered them and perhaps been more satisfied.

I will include photos of my old keds compared with the new ones. My old keds were a size 6.5W. My foot size is actually a size 6 XW so first I ordered those. The length was the same length as my old 6.5!! And the width was even thinner. So I ordered up, another size 6.5 and this time XW.
If you look at my photos obviously my old shoes are more worn and therefore more stretched out. Additionally, they're also looser in the laces. But even with these new ones looking at the soles it's clear to see they are slightly narrower and also a good couple centimetres longer.
Why do good brands have to change their design? The arch support is also less. In my old keds there was more padding in the arch.
I'm pretty disappointed because now I will definitely have to buy arch inserts if I want to wear these because I have plantar faciitis. I don't understand also why a size 6XW is narrower than a size 6.5 W. Going by a typical width size chart, (healthyfeetstore is the source) a size 6 XW should be 4 1/16"" wide whereas a size 6.5 W should be 3 3/4"" wide but the size 6XW was significantly more narrower by a substantial amount, a few centimetres, than my old 6.5 W.

These shoes have certainly changed; with less arch support, narrower sizing, and a longer length. I don't know how I feel continuing to buy them after this and I may have to find a new shoe that still carries W sizes.

Most of my complaints are things that will go away with me ""breaking in"" the shoe. I'll update my review after I've had them for a few weeks.

Pros:
They're very cute and the navy shoes are true to color.
They do have more of an ""arch support"" than I thought they would. I thought they would be more like converse in that area.
The soles are nice and thick.
The laces are the perfect length. Lace length is very important to me for some reason, I don't know.

Cons:
The fit the length of my foot, but I wish they were just a hair wider.
I have had a little bit of a problem getting the on my foot, because my heel will catch the heel of the shoe.
The canvas of the shoe is super stiff, which makes them a little difficult to maneuver if I get the heel caught. I'm sure it's mostly because they're new, and they'll soften up over time. I'll update my review after a few weeks.

About fitting. My hubby wears 11 for dress shoes and 11.5 for nike sneakers. I ordered 11 for him and they fit perfect. But only when he wears them bare foot.

I ordered a used pair (black/white, no white seams, size 11), in good condition, as used was all that was available in the size/style/color I wanted. They arrived quickly and look like someone tried them on once to maybe walk a few feet then took them off--so no problems there.

The size is spot on and maybe just slightly wider than I expected (no complaints about that). Until recently, I thought I had wide feet, but I Googled the correct way to measure your feet and found out that I'm really a 10.5 normal width instead of an 11 wide as I thought. I looked this up before I ordered of course (there were barely any 10.5's available anyway and I prefer the slightly looser fit--my feet like to have their own personal space) and was expecting a little room for socks, which there is, but I could also easily wear them with no socks or just thin liners without any worry of them sliding off (I could probably wear them without the laces and I doubt they'd slide off that way either).

The only thing I wasn't very fond of, and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is that the arch support is too far forward for my foot. The arch support starts before my arch does, which feels somewhat awkward, but it's not enough to keep me from wearing them. I'm assuming that with wear, the arch support may form to my foot better.

These shoes look great with skinny jeans and leggings. I haven't tried them with anything else yet, but I imagine they'd look cute with almost anything. I also ordered a similar pair of Ked's, the Chillax style, in a pastel color that I'm planning to wear with shorts/dresses during the summer.

I do feel that I paid a bit much for a used canvas sneaker at around $25 including shipping, but they are the shoes that I wanted. For what I paid, I hope that they last longer than generic canvas sneakers of the same style.

Updated after 1 year: This is my 3rd (I think) pair of Champions and I'm a bit disappointed. I used to rely on these for travel, but my most recent pair has been very uncomfortable for walking. There seem to be stiff pieces inside the shoe that rub the top of my foot near my big toe and the side of my foot, causing blisters. I never had this problem with previous pairs.

Update +1 more year: I was able to remove the parts of the shoe that were rubbing my foot and had no more issues. Those shoes wore out and I recently bought my 4th pair of Champions. My usual size in all shoes is an 8.5 and I could have sworn all my other Champions were true to size. Unfortunately, I got rid of the worn out pair before purchasing my new pair, so I can't check. The 8.5 I purchased in March 2017 was too big; I could fit my whole thumb in the back of the shoe and my foot was sliding around. I checked the label and it said 8.5, but it also said European size 39.5. A 39.5 is the same as a US size 9, so that explains why the shoes were too big.

So comfortable because they conform to your feet after about 4 days. Little secret from someone who has been wearing Sperry A/O's for 30 years: when you get them, take them out of the box, put them on, tie them tight, and then stand in the bathtub with your feet submerged in warm water. Once the shoes are soaked, get out and walk outside for about 30 minutes. Let them dry on your feet. This will keep you from having blisters and will expedite the breaking in process. Now some of you are asking, ""won't that ruin the look of them?"". The answer is yes the leather won't have that out-of-the-box look, but they will fit way better and everyone knows that someone wearing clean Sperry's isn't preppy anyway.

It's a very fine and comfortable shoe.  It looks very nice with chinos and a dress shirt.  It's relatively lightweight due to the foam-based sole.  The leather is quite soft for a shoe of this type and becomes more so over time.  It has kind of a greasy look to it, so the right treatment is dubbin.

This shoe is quite waterproof.  Can you step in pretty deep water and it will shed it completely...as long as it doesn't get up over the top.  If you periodically treat it with dubbin, even the leather will not be harmed by exposure to water.  Very nice shoe for wet weather.

Both times I have previously bought this shoe it lasted about 2.5 to 3 years.  This is not a real long time, in my opinion.  At the end of that time the leather is still in perfect condition and well connected to the sole.  However, the foam the sole is made out of does not last particularly well.  It wears down quite quickly and pretty soon is thin.  You start feeling the bumps on the ground beneath you.  Finally it breaks through.  I really wish they would make the sole out of a more durable material as in other ways this is an outstanding shoe.  If the sole was on par with the upper, it would be very durable indeed.  I guess that's why Doc Martens cost twice as much--their sole has some durability to it.

Note that in running shoes I wear a 9.5.  Knowing that leather can stretch over time, especially if exposed to water, I buy a full size small.  At first you can hardly walk in it and it is always snug, but that was the right size.  That was the first two shoes.  This one is also an 8.5 but it is much, much, much larger than its predecessors.  It's bordering on too large for me from day 1.  I compared it to my old shoe and even the sole is noticeably longer.  They have purposely changed their sizing.  If you buy one today, be sure to get at least a full size smaller than you normally wear because this shoe is now very LARGE for its size.","Great shoe--wish the sole was as durable as the upper.

The new 2014 model and 2015 are almost identical to the 2013 model but may be stiffer soled. I finally wore holes in my old black ones and had to replace with the 2014 or 2015 version. I still think it's wider than before and stiffer than the 2008 models for example.

Also I want to comment on discussion regarding arch support and people with flat feet wearing keds. I think that really isn't an issue. Flat feet is not a problem but a natural variation of the human foot in some people. It also occurs in some people because they wore stiff soled shoes all their lives. The arch of a foot supports itself with the muscles and tendons and no amount of artificial padding in the shoe will ""create"" an arch. Foot muscle exercises can rebuild the lost strength in the foot muscles but stretched tendons are permanent. These shoes are ok for strengthening the foot because they are fairly flexible. The best shoes to help regain strength of the foot muscles are minimalist shoes (think barefoot style). I would suggest the Merrell Barefoot line of shoes. The Enlighten, Whisper, Whirl or Avesso are some of the casual non athletic looking styles they sell. A great all purpose athletic style, maybe to rival the Keds Champion, is the Merrell Vapor Glove and Vapor Glove II. Go slow and use caution so that you don't over use week muscles and you may just find you were misinformed about arch support and foot pain.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
Did not get the ones pictured on this website(as of August 2013)! The new model is much different.

First off I should say that the Keds Chamption model that was out prior to this version was a 5 star product. Huge changes have taken that down to one star in my opinion.

The Keds Champion sports a new design for 2013 that adds billboards for their company name on the shoe. The whole point of the Keds Champion is to be somewhat understated. A simple shoe that accents an outfit not dominates it. The Keds Champion has been a go to for the originative fashion consumers of Internet fashion blogs. Its simplicity can help cement creative and custom fashions as well as those trendy and classic fashions into a harmonious look.

The new Keds Champion now demands eye attention ruining the simple understated point it once had.

The shoe retains its side Keds embroidered fabric logo from the previous model. This with a simple blue rubber heel rectangle should be enough to show others looking closely that you in fact are wearing Keds. Not in the opinion of the Keds company though.

The first billboard is the addition of white lettering to an enlarged blue label on the heel of the shoe. By increasing the blue label size and adding these large white letters I assume they are tiring to generate fervor for their product by recognition.

The second billboard is the addition of a blue and white Keds fabric label on the tongue of the shoe. An absolutely unnecessary addition that only serves to draw the eye toward the large blue letters.

Should you for some reason take your shoe off and if there is by some chance any doubt what brand shoe you are wearing, the humongous Keds logo inside the foot bed of the shoe will let anyone know that you wear Keds.

Lets say you didn't take your shoe off and are sitting there but there is still a question in the mind of someone near you if you in fact have Keds on. Well stretch your legs out or otherwise let the person see the bottom sole of the shoe and yes, you guessed it, another blue Keds logo resides on the underside of the shoe.

If you can get past all that then there is only the problem of fit. The new version seems a bit roomy to me. Both longer and wider but only wider in the heel. The fit plus the horrendous look led me to return the shoe.",Ruined a classic by changing the design.,1380326400,

Bought it because Naturalizer stopped making their Mai Tai shoe, which was a twin of the Mimosa.  Now I find the Lifestride Mimosa is becoming scarce.  Both are/were great, comfortable shoes.  Why shoe manufacturers change out basic, comfortable styles is beyond me.

With its low heel and soft cross straps, the Mimosa is very comfortable.  I need a wide shoe and the extra wide width is tough to find in a shoe nice enough to wear to fancy events.  Takes no time to break it in.  It's comfortable when I go dancing, which is eery week.  I do add Dr. Scholl's For Her Sole Expressions insoles for a bit more cushion, but it's not really needed.

I have them in White, Black, Camel, and Red.  I'd buy more colors, but they're not always available in my size & width.

My one quibble, the reason I can't give these shoes five stars, is that after a year or so of intermittent wear, no more than once a week, they tend to deteriorate, fast.  In one case, the elastic on the heel strap broke.  That's easy to repair.  In another, though, the upper materials started to flake off!

I needed some new shoes and couldn't find anything I wanted where I live now, overseas. I bought these shoes based on the size of other shoes I recently purchased, Bass Weejuns and Allen-Edmonds. I've always worn an 8D in Weejuns Logan, and to be on the safe side I purchased an 8.5D in Allen-Edmonds Wilbert. Both of these shoes fit fine, although the A-E shoes were just a bit long. These Dockers shoes seem well made, the oiled leather works well when out in the rain or with spills, and I think they will wear well. The problem is that I ordered an 8.5M, and while the width is perfect the shoes are not long enough; my toes are right at the end of the shoe and jam into the end when I walk. I need at least a 9 maybe 9.5M for these shoes to fit well. My other complaint is that the material on the inside of the shoe at the back on the heel, to keep the heel from slipping, rubs my heel raw; much worse than any other shoe I've had. Maybe that will improve as one wears the shoes, but I'm going to have to purchase another pair because even though I like the shoe they are one size too short for me.

As an additional note the Amazon size chart is useless from a buyers perspective. The sizing is off quite a bit. According to my measurements I'd need a size 10 shoe (I've never worn anything longer than a 9.5 in any shoe size).

Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles, this pair has none. The sole is stiff and clunky, the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general, junk. No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.

I cannot tell you how incredibly let down I am with this most recent pair that I purchased in May of 2015.  They are now made in China.  The leather is of inferior quality to my earlier Sperrys - it's thinner for sure.  The laces are less grippy.  I'm sorry I can't think of a better way to describe the laces.  But enough of the minor details.  Let's move on to the the more serious issues with the shoe.  It's almost entirely unlined.  Unlike previous Sperrys, the new ones only have a shoe liner for 1/2 the length of the shoe.  Why is this an issue?  The leather on the inside of the shoe is unfinished.  It's like wearing a shoe lined with sandpaper.

Sperry has gone the cost-reduction route on these shoes and the result is that they've changed from what used to be an extremely comfortable shoe  to a cheap, uncomfortable, made in China, piece of crap.

The leather is so broken in it feels like your wearing that favorite pair of shoes right at the start and the leather and color has a really nice worn look.  On the other hand, how long will that last?  I've worn mine several times and so far so good, but a pair of Sebago's on the other hand worn equal amount of times looks hardly broken in at all.  While my feet appreciate the softness of the Sperry's, I hope they last just as long as the Sebago's which look to be brand new, hefty leather (a price we pay for the fashionable worn look and feel?).  Also, the insole seems cheap to me.  Out of the box, it felt a bit uncomfortable and cardbord like with an uncomfortable crease.  With some wear, the insole shaped to my foot and became more comfortable, but I found it to be some corner cutting to cut manufacturing cost.  Not the end of the world though because it is comfortable and stylish.  I just hope the style and comfort lasts.  So far so good though as it handled several outings (some of which were heavy use) with little to no wear - and no blisters or moments of discomfort either.

The size seems consistent with other Sperry's.  I ordered a half size larger than Sebago's and its hard to say which side of the fence this falls on (is Sperry a half size smaller or is the Sebago a half size larger). Can't compare with shoes I wear with socks.",Stylish and comfortable,1434326400,

These are about the best tracks you can buy but with that said, there is still some room for improvement. The biggest problem I (and my two buddies also own these) have is that the back straps are stitched together FAR TOO LOW. They stitching is so low that it makes it extremely difficult to reach the heal of the boot. Whomever designed these must have based the prototype on sneakers or Converse or some other small, lightweight shoe. The product picture clearly demonstrates these being used with a large boot, as most users do. The placement of the stitching doesn't make any sense. It's quite stupid. SOLUTION: sever the stitches and re-sew at an appropriate height. See photos. It's a pain to have to do this but now that mine are modified, I'm pretty happy about it.

NOTE TO MANUFACTURER: adjust the stitching to an appropriate height.  Put these on your snow boots. Any boots at all and you will see what I mean. Shocking that they sell like this.

In the attached pictures you can see a side-by-side comparison of the ""before"" (left boot) and ""after"" (right boot).

So I did some research and came across these and read most of the reviews.  Though he has only worn/used them for 3 days he thinks they are the best invention since the space shuttle!  He has had no problem walking on ice; walks the dog around our neighborhood twice a day.  Not even one slip since he put these on his boots (which are extremely easy and have durable Velcro adjustments).  The sizing chart above is accurate.  Measure the length on the bottom of the boot you intend to where them over.  For example-even though my husband wears a size 10 boot, the length of the bottom of the boot he wears was 12 inches long.  So that length is what you use to determine which size to get (not so much the shoe size).  So we ordered him a size M and they are perfect!  Refer to the size/measurement chart below the picture of the item.  The manufacturer suggests that if you are between sizes to always size down because too much overhang can cause you to trip.  So better a tad short than too long.  We cannot yet speak for how long they will hold up seeing as we just have them for 3 days this product appears to be made super durable and with high end hardware.

These are extremely grippy. The metal studs on the bottom screw in and are replaceable. The studs are sharp rings of metal  that catch on ice very well. You can also walk on dry pavement just fine with them. When I am wearing these I feel so confident of my footing that I begin to forget I'm walking on ice. I bought some for my friend who likes to hike on steep trails with icy conditions and she loves them.

I wear these when the sidewalks and roads are treacherous. When things aren't so bad, I use Black Diamond trekking poles and reach the tips of the poles ahead of me so I'll know if the snow ahead is actually ice. They  fold up nicely into my backpack when I get where I'm going.

For my mom, I bought a lighter duty version called Stabilicers Heel. https://www. 32north.com/icers/25-stabilicers-heel.html . They attach at the ankle and have a plate with metal studs under the heel. They also feel great on snow and ice and adjust snugly. There are fewer metal studs which are a different shape and are not replaceable.

Both Stabilicers were far superior to the yaktrax I own. The studs outgrip the Yaktrax's round coils.

They fit end to end almost exactly.  They could be 1/4"" longer, but I think the SM size would of been too big. I tried them out, they are everything you want in cleats. The ""screw"" heads are sharpened and a bit hollowed out.  I really really like that putting these on is more like flip flops instead of wiggly snakes.
Pros: High quality product. Heavy materials used to construct. These were recommended by someone who walks outside on sidewalks and needs to prevent slipping on ice. While nothing will be one 100% slip free, these have served her very well for years. Another person jogs using these.
Cons: the heel straps are sewn together midway at the back of your heel. But they were unlikely to pass up/over the lip of my boot without either major hand to boot combat or as the other person does, slipping her boot forward until her boot heel fits in. I can't put stress on my arthritic hands tugging or pulling. I took the stitches out where the straps are sewn together so that the straps crisscross higher up on my boot and they now let my boot heel seat correctly. I will sew them together in this new orientation.
One reviewer mentioned they felt the design would let you fall off the cleats and twist an ankle. I understand and can agree. With just one on its surprising how easy you could tip to the out side and it could happen. But I never wear just one and will be mindful when walking.

If you live in a part of the world that gets snow and ice and you like to be outside in that winter weather, you won't find a better companion than these stabilicers.  Read On.....

I have owned a pair of these for over ten years and they are absolutely indestructible.  I have spent countless hours walking in the woods with my dogs....  winter spring summer fall 2 degrees 100 degrees rain, snow sleet, ice or sunshine.  Weather was only a deterrent during high winds.  Otherwise we were out there.  In the winter, after countless folks have packed down the snow on wooded paths, the path becomes an uneven treacherous sheet of ice.  I am not at all a gifted ice walker.  Without these stabilicers my neck would have broken hundreds of times by now.

I came to these through a bit of an evolution and I am writing this review in the hopes that I might save folks some money.  These are, without a doubt, the most expensive of all the walking ice cleats and that might turn some folks away, but it shouldn't.  Amortized over the lifespan of the cleats, I believe these to be the most cost effective of your choices.  I have tried the other brands and none of them have held up.  They come loose off your foot and the next thing you know they are lost forever in the snowy wilderness.  Or their rubber snaps apart rendering them useless.  None of the other brands that I've tried or friends have used have ever lasted.  As I said, my stabilicers lasted more than 10 years with almost daily winter walks.  The ONLY reason I purchased a second pair last winter is not because mine broke, but rather, I lent them to someone and I can't recall who that was and they never returned them!

I tried the stabilicers less expensive version first.  Those are stretch rubber pull-on as opposed to these which have heavy duty velcro strap closures.  The pull-on rubber version was much more difficult to put on, especially with cold and gloved fingers.  And, years ago one of them popped off while I was walking and it was never heard from again.  I contacted the 41 north company who totally stood behind the product and sent me these to try.

Seriously if I could give these ten stars, I would.  The cleats are so sturdy and effective that if I was not at all a klutz I could probably run across a frozen pond with absolutely no slipping or sliding.  If a cleat wears out you simply remove it and put in a new cleat.  Easy Peasy.  But in ten years of ownership I never once needed to replace a cleat which is kind of too bad because I actually purchased a bag of replacement cleats ten plus years ago.  At this point I have no clue where they might be.

BOTTOM LINE:  I can recommend these without the slightest hesitation or reservation.  They are the pick of the litter when it comes to ice cleats.  Seriously, if you are trying to save money by purchasing the less expensive products they just won't last the way these do and in the end you will have to keep buying new ones.  These end up less expensive in the long run.  You'll have them forever (unless you lend them to a friend and forget who)",The best traction cleats for winter ice.

FIRST IMPRESSION
These Stabilicers appear to be well made and simple. I like the layout of the screws on the bottom around the perimeter, for my intended use for edge grip. I like that the screws are replaceable and somewhat low profile and not long sharp spikes, for my use.  The screws on this style have the standard sheet metal thread, but are supposed to be hardened for wear.

FIRST USE
So far, the screws seem to wear pretty well and dig into ice well and are aggressive on surfaces other than cement so take them off outside.

The medium stabilicers say they fit men's 8-10 and measure 12"" in length. The medium fit most all of my men's size 9 boots just right and even have a little room to spare. Most of my boot outsoles measure between 11.5"" and 12"" long.

OTHER DESIGNS
I like the other styles with the tiny carbide spikes such as the Dry Guy brand. They all have the spikes in the center and not on the outer edges and the straps make ground contact and wear faster than they should, don't get me wrong I like them for flat surfaces and lower price.

Kahtoola Microspikes are a crampon style with 1/2"" to 3/4"" long spikes which are more in the midline of the sole as well and have chains which wrap around the edges of the sole. They work a little better in deeper snow while hiking and many off road conditions and are lighter weight. They work really well.

STABILICERS SCREWS
Stabilicers has replacement screws which make them a better value.

ICE RACING SCREWS
Kold Kutter brand and others make screws for installing on your own tires or boots, if the soles are thick enough. They are very similar and likely the same if not better than Stabilicers.

I love these shoes, I wore them most of the days during my summer from the beach, to around the house, to parties, shows, dinners, and even some dances. These shoes are the staple of summer clothing, and honestly fit in a very interesting niche where they can be dressed up (reasonably) or just kicked around.

I've put on probably over 75 wears with my current pair so far, and they are as perfect as the day I got them. Sometimes I would look at them after an event and notice how they were starting to look bad - but after applying some oil and brushing it, they always look as good as new.

The shoe comes soft and flexible with a removable insole.
The shoe will stretch and soften even more than it comes from the factory.
The shoe is NOT canvas. It is fabric.

The people in my family that wear size 7.5 Keds Champion shoes from a few years ago had to get a size 7 in the Chillax. One of the wearers finds the shoe a bit long. Both those wearers find the shoe to run wide, especially after being broken in.

For reference I normally wear a size 11 Keds Champion in the older model. I find the new Keds Champion size 11 loose and a bit wide.
I find the Keds Chillax 11 very loose, especially after it stretches out. I could easily step out of the shoe if not careful yet the heel stays on decently. I tried a size 10 and found it too short. I had to get the 11 because 10.5 does not seem to be an option. I think the Chillax is a wide shoe but the flexibility and softness of the fabric are so comfortable I am going to keep wearing them.

Life expectancy is probably horrendous. After just a few full days of wearing and being on my feet all day with moderate walking,  the rubber around the shoe at the seam where the fabric meets the sole starts to come separated from the fabric. This is common on Keds and Converse and similar shoes but usually takes a good few months to achieve the same separation.

Out of the 6 pair we own, two came defective! Yikes! To be honest though, including finding the correct size we ordered 8 shoes total but kept only 6. So that is 2 of 8 that came defective. You read into that what you want.

One had black marks probably from the assembly machine all along the rubber edge every few inches.

I put them over a zip-up short shoe boot and they fit well. I wouldn't doubt an athletic shoe would fit if you size it right. The replaceable ""cleats"" are small bolts, screwed in on the outside edges of the unit (the Lite version has ""teeth"" in the middle of the overshoe), but they ARE small bolts. So, you have just added the weight of a handful of bolts to each shoe. Which makes the workout better but judge for yourself. I also just used them for walking, but the unit is flexible enough for running. Because the cleats are on the edges of the sole, you may slide a bit before they grip if you're on an uneven surface, but walking on fairly smooth sheet-ice, I was fine, but they are heavy!
Vs Stablicer Lite: The lite is lighter weight but has little tombstone-shaped teeth in the MIDDLE of the sole. I used this for 2 mile plus walks in snow/ice mix and they worked very well. Both go on and off fairly well, but not as easily as YakTrax. You are NOT walking on the retaining structure with the Stabilicers, and so the traction cleats are not wearing out the shoe retaining structure.
Vs YakTrax Original. I prefer the Yaks for keeping in the car for emergencies since they are the easiest on/off and seem to fit the widest varieties of footwear. HOWEVER, in the YakTrax, you are walking on the web structure of the unit so when one of the stretchy rubber ""webs"" gets worn and breaks, the whole  device fails OR at least the traction does. I didn't and wouldn't use YakTrax for distance or running unless you don't care that you have to repurchase when the structure fails. For just doing some shoveling or outdoor tasks, or for emergencies and frequent on/off, the YakTrax are ideal. The traction is metal-wrapped around the underfoot web and works very well.
Vs YakTrax Sport: I sent them back; the toe pocket wouldn't hold a boot, shoe or running shoe and the whole front slipped off on the way to the mailbox, only the Velcro strap held the device on. In THEORY, they're great since they combine cleats in the front and YakTrax metal-wrapped coils under the heel, so they're light and grip well, but the way it fits on footwear has to be rethought.","NOT ""lightweight"", but great on sheet ice!

I recently ordered another pair of Keds (canvas champions) in size 11 and they fit perfectly (for me, meaning they're a little loose, but don't slide off). My feet measure as a 10.5 normal width, but I like a little room for socks or whatever, so I usually order an 11 to get that, and sometimes I don't have a choice, because half sizes aren't as common. I received this Chillax pair with both labeled as 11, yet neither fit like the other Ked's size 11 I just bought (also on Amazon). The left shoe fits and is a little snug/narrow, but comfortable (so it's probably closer to an actual size 10.5). The right shoe is about 1/4"" smaller in length and width according to my ruler and my foot. I can get it on, but it pinches me (probably near a size 10).

If these shoes were the same size, and the right size, they would be 5 stars. I love the soft pastel colors.

I am 510, 195 lbs, and would typically wear a Large in most similar styled (button-up) shirts, but I have to get a Medium in Columbia PFG shirts.  (The Medium is still a moderately loose fit, as the Large is like a tent on me).  Tip number two is that because these shirts are on different sizing scale, many get returned to the Amazon Warehouse, so keep an eye for Amazon Warehouse deals on these shirts (see tips to finds the easiest way to compare prices across sizes and colors at the conclusion of this review).  I have tried the Tamiami II, Bahama II, and Bonehead (AND new Blood & Guts III  see below for updated comparison including the BG3 series) versions of the Columbia PFG shirts, and have been mostly pleased with all of them.  The Tamiami II was my favorite due to the cooling effect of the weave, but the similar Blood & Guts III is now right there with it.  My reasoning for giving the Bahama II 4 starts instead of 5, is that out of the four series discussed in this review, it is my least favorite.  The Bahama II tends to wrinkle, is not as cool feeling in extreme heat as the open weave Tamiami or Blood&Guts, and the nylon tend to feel slimy during periods of heavy perspiration.  Below I have noted the differences in four of the PFG styles, for those trying to decide which shirt they may prefer.

TAMIAMI II STYLE (POLY) - SUMMERTIME CASUAL FAVORITE
The Tamiami II (T2) and the Blood & Guts III (BG3) are my favorite of the aforementioned PFG styles.  The main difference between each of these styles is material.  The T2 & BG3 are 100% polyester (liner and exterior), the Bahama II (Ba2) is nylon, and the Bonehead (BH) is poplin cotton.  The T2 is the thinnest/lightest (most breathable) material of the three styles, also has a slightly shinier appearance, and is probably the most wrinkle resistant of the three (as the fabric is less rigid that the nylon Bahama II or cotton Bonehead).  (Update 7/11/16  The Blood & Guts series is also breathable polyester similar to the Tamiami with a slightly different styling, and stain resistant fabric.  See update at end of review for full comparison.)  The T2 has a snap button pocket on top with Velcro pockets underneath on both sides, which I also prefer over the pocket style on the other two (Ba2 & BH have identical pocket styles).  The synthetic T2 and Ba2 both wick moisture and create a cooling effect better than the cotton BH, but the lightness and weave of the T2 makes it by far the coolest wearing of the three.  For outdoor activity in the heat and humidity of summer, it would definitely be my preferred choice.  The long-sleeve version is fantastic for offshore fishing when lightweight sun protection is essential.  The Ta series also does not wrinkle as badly as the Ba and BH series shirts do.  (The PFG apparel which has an SPF rating, such as the Tamiami & Blood/Guts series, has an open fabric weave which is lose enough to allow some penetration of UV through the material itself; which means the material is much more breathable ergo cool feeling, although technically you could get some UV exposure through the shirt.)

BAHAMA II STYLE (NYLON) - WORK WEAR IN MILD WEATHER
The Bahama II is the middle ground between the T2 and the BH.  It is synthetic - similar to the T2, but is a nylon exterior shell with a polyester liner (whereas T2 is poly liner and shell).  The pockets on the Ba are the same traditional Columbia PFG look as the pockets on the Bonehead.  The slightly more rigid feel of the nylon, also gives the Bahama a more traditional (cotton-look) appearance than the T2.  In a certain respect, the Ba nylon manages moisture better than the BH cotton version  i.e. it evaporates sweat more quickly.  On the other hand, the nylon does not absorb moisture as cotton does, so while it does dry faster, it has a slimy feel to when sweaty that simply is not comfortable.  The Bahama also wrinkles worse than any of the other PFG series shirts, so it is my least favorite series.  That said, it is still a good quality shirt, and makes for a great work shirt during temperate weather (i.e. when it isn't going to get slimy with sweat).

BONEHEAD STYLE (COTTON) - COOL WEATHER FAVORITE
Most everything has already been covered.  The BH and the aforementioned Ba styles look virtually identical.  Essentially, I like the Bonehead over the Bahama because it does not get that slimy feeling when you sweat, and it is slightly better from a wrinkle perspective.  The Bonehead is probably my favorite series when moisture management and cooling effect are not important, so I like these in long sleeve for fall and winter wear.  I also like the traditional appearance of the Ba and the BH for work wear, but the T2 look I like better for casual.  (The newer Blood & Guts series has the comfort of the Tamiami series, but has a look similar to the Bonehead, so it is my new favorite summertime work shirt.)  The Bonehead long sleeve also makes a great layering option for hunting season, and Sage is a great natural neutral (earth tone) color for this purpose.

UPDATE 7/11/16  BLOOD & GUTS III (POLY) - HOT WEATHER FISHING FAVORITE
When this review was originally posted, I only contrasted the Bahama, Tamiami, and Bonehead series shirts, but recently I have found a new favorite  the Blood & Guts III (BG3).  While the name may not be all that appealing, these are really great shirts.  They have an SPF rating, therefore breathable/open weave, similar to the Tamiami, with a styling that more closely resembles the Bahama & Bonehead series.  The BG3 is also treated for stain resistance, making it a great shirt for fishing, work, and outdoor activities.  Finally, the BG3 does not wrinkle nearly as severely as the Bahama nylon or Bonehead cotton shirts do.  Out of the four PFG series shirts discussed, the BG3 series probably have the tightest fit.  I still wear a medium in the BG3, but the series has a slimmer type cut than the previous versions discussed.  All in all, this is my favorite alongside the Tamiami.  I slightly prefer the Blood & Guts for fishing due to the stain resistance, whereas, I prefer the Tamiami for casual and boating wear just from an aesthetic standpoint.  The Tamiami may have the slightest of edges in the cooling department, but they are very close in that regard.

AMAZON PRICE COMPARISON & WAREHOUSE DEALS
I used to always get aggravated at the way Amazon list apparel items with multiple colors, as it can take forever to search through multiple color (and size) options to see the cheapest offerings.  On my iPad version the color prices are displayed in a list style automatically, but on my PC desktop I would have to select each color/size to see the price options.  I did not realize there is a much simpler way.  Select the new and used from (or new if no used offerings available) icon, which will take you to a list view.  There must be multiple offerings for the exact size and color selected for this option to appear, so if you do not see the new and used from hyper-link, then select another size/color combination till the link appears.)  In the list view screen, select your size and click the lowest offer for each icon beside the color selector.  It will display the cheapest offering for each color shirt in that size, so you can quickly see which colors are the cheapest.  Also, this view will show any Amazon Warehouse Deals available.  As mentioned in the first paragraph, these shirts get returned often due to sizing issues, so many times the Warehouse deals are shirts that were tried on and immediately returned for a smaller size.","Comparison of Columbia Tamiami II, Bahama II, Blood & Guts III, and Bonehead PFG Shirts",1443052800,

The neoprene does stretch a little more than I would like so I'm not sure how they will handle hiking or a long day walking.  I suspect they might begin to chafe.  They are really comfortable both with socks and without so I think a day on the river will prove very enjoyable in these shoes.  I typically wear a women's 8.5 so I ordered the big kid's 6 wide (they didn't have half sizes).  I'm glad I didn't upsize to the 7 because it would have been way too big.  As it was, these fit a little bit loose and were more than long enough.  So I would say when ordering for an adult who isn't going to grow out of their shoes, order the half size down if you usually wear a half size shoe.  As a woman, I find women's shoes lack a good supportive footbed, so I often check the boy's section of the shoe store for sport shoes.  They are usually more supportive and half the price of the exact shoe in adult sizes.

I have not tried hiking any distance in these shoes yet since it has been raining steadily here since the shoes arrived and the mountains still have snow.  I have gone on short walks and they are fairly comfortable with a thick wool sock but they do move around too much and might cause hot spots or blisters on a longer walk/hike.  Due to the stretchy nature of the neoprene I would suggest these shoes are better for water sports than for hiking.","Great for water, not so sure about running/hiking",1461715200,

These shoes held up well and it dries up fast.

Plus it's comfortable, cool, not prone to wrinkles and rocks the safari look. I love the sage color but be forewarned it's similar to park ranger and zoo keeper attire. I was asked for park information a couple times while enjoying the California Redwoods! Next time around, I'll spring for the blue Bahama...

The workmanship of this made in Vietnam shirt is excellent but, as other reviewers noted, runs at least one size too large. I'm 5'8"" 140LBs with slim athletic build (biker/runner) and normally wear small. However, I bought extra small and it fits okay but is still oversized, sort of a 1980s tent shirt fit. I've been wearing Columbia jackets and shirts for years and most run a size large, so par for the course.

I live in the tropics and the sun burns me through my t-shirt within 30 minutes. UV protection is excellent and I'm good for hours of shooting without a hint of redness. As for coolness, it's okay but not much better than a normal light cotton shirt. The nylon fabric is more prone to abrasion than cotton shirts: Cordura bags and daypack straps tend to ""sand"" it if you walk around all day.

Finally, as a photographer I find the large pockets useful for holding filters, memory cards, lens caps, etc. The velcro makes for quick one-handed access and the pockets expand enough to hold a small lens.

First impressions:  These leggings are incredibly comfortable.  (Time out for a brief digression:  Spandex is the best thing to happen to women's fashion since, heck, forever.)  As a middle-aged woman, I love the midrise cut of these leggings:  Low enough to be fashionable, but high enough so you can squat or bend over without worrying about showing more than any mortal should have to see.  The Lee leggings also include a comfy flannel-like lining between the waistline and upper thighs that add to the comfort of the pants.  Other reviewers have noted that they wished the lining extended the whole length of the leggings; I agree that would be nice for creating a set of leggings for cold weather wear, but the omission of the lining full-length make the current model more appropriate for warmer climates.

Now let's talk fit.  I'm 5'5"" and currently 130 pounds.  The size 10 pair when it arrived was a bit baggy; I probably should have gone for a 8 or maybe even a 6.  But they were not so loose they were uncomfortable, and given the middle-aged lady factor, I'd infinitely prefer them to be a bit baggy than a bit too form-fitting.

My advice is to add the two inches. If you wear a size 36 pants, buy the 38"" belt or larger so you have a little extra to feed into the loop and feel comfortable.

I wear 34 waist pants (though, with the prevalence of vanity sizing, my waist is probably closer to 35), and based on several reviews saying you should order the same size as your waist, I ordered a Size 34 belt.  Wrapping the belt around my waist, I could barely get the tip of the leather to touch the outer-most tip of the buckle -- much less actually buckle it.

The 6-7 other belts I own are all Size 36 and they all fit well.  In this case, I don't think a 36 would be quite long enough for me.  Based on my experience, I would recommend ordering 2 sizes up from your waist size, but certainly no less than 1 size up.

As for the belt itself, it appeared well constructed for the price, but it was less attractive in person than in the Amazon photos.  Specifically, the belt I received was noticeably darker than in the picture.  That said, if you can get the sizing right, this appears to be a very good value.",A little help with sizing,1383177600,

I always wear equipment such as walkies and holsters on my belt. Other belts have peeled, simply come apart, or slowly disintegrated. I've actually had belts that just seem to chip away.

Very simply, this belt still looks and feels new. Really, there's not much evidence to show that it's been abused in any way. I'm pretty sure this belt is going to last quite a few more years, and then probably a few more after that.

When a belt is this durable for only 15 bucks you'd be a fool to pay anything more for anything else. No, it's not made from crocodile skin and it wasn't made by a 10th generation Italian leather worker, but it doesn't need to be. It's a belt. A belt that will last you a lot longer than the belt you'd spend $40 dollars for at the department store.

Well, good news, this polo was a winner!  Smile. Happy wife! This one is more to his comfort level and less to my liking in terms of fit.  It's cut a bit wider than others and the shoulders a bit broader. Slightly large but not too big... Buttons look sharp!  I took some photos that show care instructions, collar, side slit (to show if it has one or not) and fit on him. It's a nice weight too.

For reference, he is 6' tall and weighs about 240 lb. I ordered and received it in an XXL. We feel this was an excellent value and would recommend it to others. The Bark color arrived as advertised, a nice olive-brown, and washes up nicely. (We wash as instructed but hang dry all of his polos.)

In case anyone else happens to be looking for some good inexpensive polos...  A few others we purchased, aside from this one, and are happy with are as follows (I'm posting reviews with photos for those also):

I am an Athletic Trainer and travel with a college sports team. It's important to me to get a shirt that fits well, doesn't fade, shrink, or snag. I am usually a size L or XL in unisex size t-shirts or ladies size 14/16. Upon measuring myself and looking at the size chart I decided to order an XXL. It fits as well as it could. If your a small petite woman keep in mind this shirt isn't overly fitted. I'm larger though and my only wish is that it would be slightly longer so I could tuck it in. However, it is long enough for me to raise my hands over my head and not have my stomach show.  The texture of the shirt is only slightly more sheer than a 100% cotton polo. I would NOT consider it a silk texture like in the title. However, It does show bra lines. I don't think this will snag too easily unlike some 100% polyester shirts (this shirt is 65% polyester 35% cotton). I do wish the styling was more feminine. The front where it buttons down is large like a mans and only has three buttons. Care instructions say to wash in cold water and dry on low so I am fearful I will shrink it by accidently putting it through the dryer on medium or high heat.  Only time will tell if this shrinks, snags, or fades. I'll update my review if the shirt doesn't hold up adequately.

Note - before commenting on the quality of the product, I want to stipulate that I followed the manufacturers washing instructions to the letter!

At first I thought that being silk they were just more fragile than regular material.  They ARE extremely comfortable.  However, I started to notice that they were always coming apart at the seams, and the fabric would unravel making a sewing repair very difficult, if not impossible.

I decided to give them one more try, as they're really very soft and comfortable.  I ordered two more pair, and they began to fall apart even more rapidly than before (only lasted about six - eight weeks). Note - they always seem to last just long enough to preclude being able to return them for a refund.

My advice - they cost nearly $70 bucks a pair now, and they aren't worth $7. If you reall must have black, remember you were warned.

If you like other colors, you can find other brands which hold up VERY well.

I had wanted another pair of moccasins in the store I was at, but they didn't have my size, so I settled for these.  Best thing that could have happened. Every year (maybe 14-16 months) since I have bought a pair of these shoes (because I run them into the ground.  Literally. The soles fall off, the leather gets holes.  Not because of bad craftsmanship either, I just wear them that much.)  They are so soft, so comfortable.  And I always get a size down because they STRETCH.  I usually wear 8/8.5, so I get a 7/7.5.  One year I got an 8 and within two weeks they had stretched super huge to where they flopped around on my foot.  My mistake though (and they were still super comfy).  The deerskin is so malleable and thin and soft that after they are broken in (takes about a day) it feels as if nothing is on your foot.

I wear these every day, everywhere, for everything, but they are not meant to be in water- not even the rain.  That doesn't stop me from doing it, just know that if they get wet they'll do what lightly-treated leather does and get kinda stiff.  Also, kind of a funny anecdote:  I was once camping and had my feet resting up on the edge of the fire ring and the glue holding the sole on melted and the sole started peeling off (so don't put these near flames...obvious to the non-oblivious).  I quickly slammed my foot back down onto the sandy ground where the glue instantly hardened back to the sole, though it was a little misshapen.  Still wore them for another 7 months.

The silk stuff we currently use works great but we wanted to push the envelope and see just how cold it could get and still be comfortable.  We also did not want to bother with the expense of heated gear so we decided to try this product.

We went out today, temps ranged between the mid 40's to low 50 degree range.  Instead of our heavy weight outer gear we wore our mid weight stuff (mesh jackets with liner in  a tee shirt and fleece pants) over this product.  That is it. The base layer preformed beautifully.  We were dry, comfortable and most importantly warm.  Today was supposed to be a short two hour trip but we ended up staying out all day. When we got home and peeled out of our clothes the tee were damp but the Poly was bone dry as was our skin.  Love it.

These tights DO NOT RUN (no matter how much you abuse them), are heavy duty, and have soft padding on the balls and heel of your feet, so you are not walking on fishnet all night. The pads do not fit all the way across your feet, so the edges of your feet will be hitting fishnet, but the heels and balls are covered, which is where most of your weight is distributed. The fact that the pads don't go all the way across the bottom of your feet is a plus if you are wearing open sandals or high heels, as the padding won't show around your feet. I gave these a 4 instead of a 5 as they really HURT after a while (I debated on giving them a 3 because of this, but THEY DON'T RUN!). If you have thighs that rub, expect blisters if you wear them for more than an hour or so. Also, expect massive ribbing once these come off. It can take up to 12 hours for the marks to go away on me. I do have sensitive skin, but even for those without, I would expect these to bite. They are heavy duty and feel as such. I've read other reviews where people wear another set of hose underneath the fishnet, to keep the pain and marks away, but for me that is too much heat, especially if you are dancing.

Besides, I always wanted a pair of black ballet shoes!

The Bad:
- it's kinda hard to tell which shoe is which. The right and the left look exactly the same. At least to me.
- The front of the shoe seems just a little high. Not really a big deal, but I guess it's a question of aesthetics.
- The elastic band comes pre attached. Not me, but Im sure the pros would like to measure and sew it in themselves given their difference in arch and other feet criteria.

The GOOD!:
- I love them! I love the feel and look of the leather without being too shiny.
- They look very lean and they mold quite nicely to my feet. There's no weird gap when I go on releve or eleve.
- the adjustable elastic is quite long so picking a comfort zone is fairly easy and it doesn't cut into my skin or bother me in any way.
- The heel of the shoe is perfect for my feet. (I have a rather large heel which makes it hard to shop for certain shoes.)
- The shoe stays on comfortably whether Im wearing tights or not.
- The shipping was free with Prime and I got them within 3 days. The packaging was the original and in mint condition.
- The canvas insert in the soles is barely noticeable and it's more comfortable for pointing.
- Also, it grips the floor just fine when standing and slides easily when needed.

Ok, so I'm no ballerina but I've had ballet classes before so I know enough to invest in the right brands and products but not enough to be considered an expert. Ive always been a big fan of Capezio and I have a lot their stuff including jazz shoes, which are almost 9 years old! Since leather it's so easy to keep clean I figured I should give Bloch a chance. The capezios also split soles with a bit of a heel and a Neoprene stretch arch insert that's constantly ""pulling"" which makes it harder to sustain a second position. Besides, I bought them for a ballet/social dance class  which made sense at the time. Also, the top part of the shoe kind of hits me where my foots bends. The Bloch Women's Prolite II Hybrid Ballet Slipper is a much comfortable shoe for ballet and its a much better fit","beautiful, comfortable, affordable and totally worth it!",1422921600

It was the opposite with this particular hybrid - it enveloped my feet well, however it was a bit scrunching on the sides of my toes.  That's why I chose the Prolite Leather 5.5 B. I prefer to have room all around the sides of my feet and know that dancing will stretch out the front toe part of the slippers eventually.  So if you have narrow feet, 5.5B in these hybrids will work for you and 5.5A in the Prolite Leather will be a fit as well.  Medium width feet might need a 5.5 C in this brand (the hybrid).

3,2,TRUE,"11 1, 2015",ATVSCP0606EFT,B0002RRN4M,"{'Size:': ' 8.5 M US', 'Color:': ' Black'}",Maria Wolf,"SIZE: I ordered both the Capezio Women's Suede Sole Jr. Footlight and the Capezio Women's Jr. Footlight Character. Both models fit me like the description from Capezio predicted (one like street shoe size, the other half a size up). I normally wear a 7.5. Luckily, I got free returns so that I could order several sizes and I did not have to rely on the review only, but I would recommend to order several sizes when you are unsure like me. For this one, half a size up worked for me, but it was on the big side.
WIDTH: The shoe is quite narrow, which I liked because I have slim feet. Maybe that is why some people find it smaller than street shoe size or maybe the deviation from street shoe size is larger when you go up in size. One thing that is strange is that while the shoe is narrow and fit me, the band for the ankle was too wide. If you have thin ankles, you might need to make an extra hole in the fastening.
FOOTBED: I preferred the footbed of the caramel colored shoes, which feel like (fake) leather. The black shoes have a soft bed from a fabric that feels almost like fleece and my feet sweat quickly in it.
BALANCE: One issue that I have with all four pairs of Capezio shoes that I ordered (will return 3) is that the heel seems to be at a slightly different angle than the front part of the shoe. So when I have my toes/the ball of the foot on the ground, the back part of the heel does not touch the ground. When I have the weight on the heels, the toes/ball of the feet do not touch the ground - which feels very unstable. Maybe this is because these shoes must also work for tap dancing (they have a hole in the heel so that you can put a tap heel on it). I hope that the heel will not break because of the uneven weight distribution. I accept this, because the shoes are only 35 dollars.
COMFORTABLE: Yes, the shoes are comfortable. I am not used to wearing heels and I tend to buy comfortable, high quality shoes (like ecco or clarks). But I needed danceable shoes that go with a dress, and these are good for that. These shoes are comfortable enought so that I can walk and dance in them. For ballroom dancing, I would prefer the ones with suede sole (which were not available in my size). The leather sole has a light perforation but I need to practice with it because it is so slick.
COLOR: I preferred the black color although beforehand I had thought that the caramel color would go with more outfits. If you have pale skin like me, the caramel shoes do not look flattering.","For me, 1/2 up was perfect (but almost too large!). Normally size 7.5",1446336000,

If its heels, I purchase anywhere from a 9.5 to a 10.5, depending on the width of the toe and the height of the heel. It really just depends on the shoe. I relate all this to relate my experience with this particular pair of shoes.

I purchased the size 10.5 W and they're an absolutely perfect fit. The inside lining is soft and nicely padded- super comfy! I'm wearing these shoes for a play that requires me to be on my feet almost continuously for several hours and I have yet to experience any foot fatigue.

Since I am fairly tall, I wanted something with a teeny bit of heel for a feminine look, but not so tall that I tower over the man who plays opposite me in the show. These shoes have a perfect height heel for me.

I would highly recommend these shoes to anyone who will be on their feet for long periods of time.

1. Sizing: for once I used a sizing chart provided, erred towards the smaller size (rounded down) and the product fits, well, like a glove. It is true that it is difficult to put them on and take them off, but once on they fit absolutely perfect and snug, as they should. This means I can spread all my fingers comfortably, make a fist etc. without being constrained. At the same time I have hardly any space left at the end of my fingers, which is great.
2. Beautiful, classy design: knuckle cut outs, decorative seams, great proportion.
3. Attention to detail on the seams and knuckle cut outs is obvious, everything looks perfect.
4. Very fine, soft leather.
5. Great colors to choose from.
6. Made in Italy.
7. Come beautifully packaged in a suede-like pouch with Orsini's logo embroidered on it. Nice if those are a gift.

CONS:

I am basically happy with them, although they are not my favorite tights.  They look pretty much on me like they do on the leg in the official product image (I have very pale skin).  I think ""opaque sheer"" might be a self-contradictory term, but they are thicker than pantyhose and thinner than some of my other tights and you can sort of see my skin tone through parts of these where they are stretched the most.

Regarding the fit.  I am near the very bottom of the size range for size 2 according to the chart on the back of the package, which is what I ordered (I am 5'5"", 122 pounds; I think the minimum was 5'5"", 120 pounds).  And these were still pretty tight on me.  (For what it's worth, I carry most of my weight in my bottom half.)  So I'd suggest sizing up for sure.  I don't think these would be particularly comfortable on someone at the top of the size range for size 2, and I'm really glad I didn't go with a size 1.  While these are not control top, I do feel just a bit of pressure from them around my midsection (they go up way over my navel).

So far these have held up pretty well.  I didn't rip or tear them while putting them on (this happens with regular pantyhose -- I try about three pairs for every one pair I get successfully on) and they don't have any runs.  I wash in the washing machine (cold water, delicate cycle, in a lingerie bag) and hang to dry, and that has been working for me thus far.  They are not too heavy but are a good weight for fall (in Georgia, which is probably warmer than fall elsewhere).  Right now, I am wearing them with a midi-length dress and a pair of booties, so pretty much only the tops of my shins are showing, but I am liking the way they look with this outfit.

They are OK, although more shear than I expected, and the waistband is VERY tight and unyielding.  So, it's very difficult to get them on.  However, my problem is that the description of the item shows that it is for a 3-pk. (This detail doesn't show in the product information until after you enter a size.)  I didn't think this could be accurate, so I contacted Amazon through it's chat room and had a lengthy discussion with the representative.  He repeatedly assured me that I would, indeed, receive three pair for $9.00, as stated.  But, I wasn't surprised when the package arrived and only contained one pair.  After several emails to rectify this, I was promised that I would receive a 3-pk, plus I was welcome to keep the pair I had already received.  But, once again, the package arrived with just one lonely pair of tights. After contacting them, once again, I am now waiting for my third pair.  Actually, $9.00 is a very fair price for one pair.  However; if a company advertises it as a 3-pk for that price, then that's what they should provide.  Even after my suggesting (several times) that they change the description to ""per pair"", it still remains the same.  And, I'm still waiting for my third pair.

I had an old pair of gold toe full calf dress socks that I've been clinging to because I wasn't able to find any that were as comfortable and went high enough on the calf.

I decided to try these out, and I am so glad I did. First off, they are very comfortable. The material on the sole of the foot is slightly thicker than the rest of the sock, giving you more comfort, but still keeping them thin. The heel is also reinforced the same way, so I have no concern that these will wear prematurely. But for me, the most important thing is that these are truly full calf length, and they actually stay up. The only time I'm pulling in them is when I first put them on at the start of the day. I measured them to 14 inches above my ankle bone, and they stop right below my knee. I'm 6'4"", so they will definitely be tall enough for most.

I can plainly see my skin thru the seam there, and on top of that, there is a hole about the size of a pearl where the two parts meet.

I wear white cotton crew socks basically every day, two pairs on workout days. I wear them with high-impact athletic shoes, work/walking shoes, and occasionally heavy work boots. I want them to last (no holes, no saggy tops), I want them to be comfortable, and I want a fair value for my money.

So when I retired my old inventory nearly two years ago, I picked up five different brands of white crew socks.

Durability: As I wore the socks, I tried to be very diligent about 'rotating stock' -- pulling socks to wear from the right-side of the drawer, putting in freshly-laundered ones on the left. In theory, they all received about the same amount of wear-and-tear.

Wigwam (2/5): Unraveled at the top quickly -- after the first washing, three socks; after the third or fourth, almost every sock had loose tops. These thick socks took around a year before I started seeing holes in the toes or heel.
Under Armour (4/5): Some unraveling around the 8 or 9 month mark, no holes until year two.
Fruit of the Loom (3/5): Little unraveling, but heels thinned before the end of the first year, leading to holes.
Hanes Cushion Crew (3/5): Modest unraveling, but moderate holes at toes and heels around the 9-12 month mark.
Gold Toe Cotton Crew Athletic (5/5): Outstanding -- so far, no unraveling; two toe holes, one heel hole.

Comfort: There's two factors for me -- first, softness; second, thickness/padding. Also, I'm not looking for a compression sock (like for when I fly, or if I develop CHF) -- nothing *too* tight (and none of them were).

Wigwam (3/5): Very thick (for a crew sock), well-padded; stiff -- even after months of washing, they almost felt starched.
Under Armour (5/5): Good thickness; started soft, became even softer after a few washes.
Fruit of the Loom (3/5): Felt slightly thin; good softness.
Hanes Cushion Crew (4/5): Good thickness; slightly stiff, but not as bad as Wigwam).
Gold Toe Cotton Crew Athletic (5/5): Thick, but not too thick; softest out-of-the-plastic, and better as time went by.

Value: All bought on the same date, non-sale prices (just standard Amazon prices)

Their 'normal' size socks have worked for me - both athletic and dress - over the years.  However, since I began wearing size 14 shoes several years ago, I've had to stretch my socks when putting them on for them to fit, and then, even with reinforcement, over time the toes would start to wear thin.  (Note: 'Extra Large' socks, when available, have proven too large and too loose on my foot.)

Now, with these Extended Size socks that are made to stretch just enough for each different person's foot, I have socks that feel fully comfortable [as opposed to 'stretched tight'], including that they rise a bit higher on my calf.

The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 stars, was that something has to be 'really spectacular' for me to give it the maximum rating.  While these socks are very comfortable to wear, they don't quite make it to that level. [Very few products do for me.]

Had to come back to modify my earlier review.

While I still agree with everything I wrote about these socks previously, I was tempted to change my rating to 3 stars.  However, I still believe they are better than ""Just OK"".

Sadly, these socks do not stack up to the quality of the Gold Toe products that I have worn over several decades.  And I would have to make the comparison with other brands products I have occasionally worn over the years.

After being washed several times, some of them seem to lose 'body'.  Even right out of the packaging, they feel like a 'cheaper' brand's products - not what I've come to expect from GOLD TOE.  And then there's the matter of the amount of lint I find in the dryer's 'catcher' after washing them (and on the floor too when putting them on or taking them off).

In truth, I would still purchase this product because it's about the only one that fits easily and comfortably, without extreme stretching.

My running shoes are 12 4E. I buy these Gold Toe socks in the 13-15 range and find them very comfortable. The next size down are less comfortable for me.

One of the reviews I've read for this product indicates these aren't large enough for men with big calves. I have large calves and don't find these to be restrictive. I have dress socks that leave indentations on my leg by the end of the day but that hasn't been my experience with these Gold Toe Crew Socks.

In the most helpful negative review showing as of his writing, the reviewer complains first that the socks come up too high, but then goes on to describe how the socks shrank (see comment) and that the socks are now just basically crew socks. I guess I'm lost - aren't these supposed to be crew socks? Maybe he meant to write ankle socks? I don't know, but I'm left wondering why that review was helpful to others because it just left me confused.

Another reviewer commented on how these socks keep his feet warm. I guess that depends on your climate and the time of the year. I live in Chicago and we have cold winters and these socks aren't what I consider warm. They're not warm enough to wear around the house in the winter as the only thing covering my feet but they're fine with shoes. As a matter of fact, I have these on as I am writing this review (socks only, no shoes). It's about 50F (equal to 10C) outside and my feet are a bit cold.

My only dislike of these socks is that they don't have much padding on the heel. Some other cotton crews I have tried have thicker cotton on the soles. It's not an issue of comfort or warmth, but one of durability. I think these would last longer if they would beef up the material in the heel of the sock. That's always the first part of this sock to go and once the heel blows out on a sock it's finished.

Overall I think these are good socks. I appreciate that they come in larger sizes and I don't think this price is out of line for a larger size 3-pack of crews.

Unfortunately, these socks did not live up to their predecessors. I'm no sock connoisseur, but the previous pairs I had were insanely comfortable. These pairs unfortunately were not.

I read some reviews of people saying the quality had went down, but I choose to ignore them since there were so many positive reviews that praised these socks. Upon putting the first sock on I was extremely underwhelmed, the quality that made me trust the Gold Toe brand was gone.  These honestly felt no better than socks I've purchased from dollar store in bulk, only different was they cost three times as much.

Excellent price
Warm winter wear (would not recommend for summer).
Good thickness of material provides cushion  comfort to foot bottom
Attractive for casual and dress wear
Although complaints appear regarding shedding of lint, I have not experienced that after 3 wash cycles.
Size 10-13 just right for my 11 shoe size. but might be too small for shoe size 12.

Cons:
The only con, and this is a serious one, is that the top elastic band and the rib design of the socks leave deep impressions on my shins and ankles,  causing severe discomfort although  they are of average girth. As a result, I will not buy more in the future and hesitate to recommend. However, I am rating it 4 stars since I don't see many complaints regarding this problem. If anyone can suggest a way of diminishing the elasticity, it will be deeply appreciated

Update:
I reduced my rating from 4 stars to one simply because I cannot wear these socks because they are much too tight. I regret that I didn't return them shortly after my purchase, but now they just lie in my drawer and will probably be donated to charity with four pairs never worn.

I have a pair of gold toe socks that I bought thirty years ago and still occasionally wear. These are nowhere near the quality of the old ones. I am in my eighties and with age,one's skin thins and this may be part of the reason why my shins and ankles feel strangulated, leaving deep impressions of the socks' ribs and tops on my flesh.

Six pairs of socks.  Put the first pair on and found them to be comfortable, fit perfectly.  Second pair of socks, the elastic on one sock was unstrung and hanging loose but I wore them anyway and clipped off the dangling elastic thread--this sock will not likely stay up in the future after several washings.  Third pair of socks, I found a hole in the foot of one of the socks--a small hole that will undoubtedly grow larger over time.  Fourth pair of socks, discovered a rather large hole in the ankle area of one sock.  I haven't worn the fifth or sixth pair yet.

Let me be perfectly clear:  these are the worst made socks I've ever bought.  It is an insult to charge 20 bucks for 6 pair.  The socks I bought have a multitude of flaws and they cost considerably more than the bargain white crew socks you can find at any Walmart or ""dollar"" store.

anyway, aside from the extreme hazard of a sharp nail being in them, they're pretty great. my feet and calves feel so protected, as if i'm wearing armor. i went with polyurethane instead of the more shiny leather option because polyurethane breathes better and i don't have clothes that go with super shiny boots. they look slightly more casual without the shine imo but everyone else still gasps and when they see me wearing them, haha.

they're surprisingly easy to walk in! i've never worn platform shoes before, and i've only worn heels once in my entire life. it's awkward at first getting used to the weight and not knowing exactly where the bottom of your boot is (since theres 5 inches between you and the ground), and getting used to the excess leather from the buckles brushing against each other as you walk. i would have to waddle like a penguin if i wanted to avoid them touching, lol. they are a little heavy but that's probably just because i'm not used to wearing boots in general, tbh. actually, these are A LOT easier to walk in than my snow boots and the weight is easier to handle. i mean, they're no substitute for snow boots, but they fit better than my snow boots do. of course that's not really relevant because no one knows what my snow boots even are, but i digress.

i wear a size 9 and so i got a 9, but i can see why other reviews say to go a size up. i have to wear thin socks or they're hard to zip, BUT this is with all the buckles being as tight as possible so i could probably just adjust them if i wanted to wear thick socks. so far i've been wearing thigh high socks with them. they're snug but i like them that way, i could easily loosen the bottom buckles if i needed more room.

I wasn't happy with the options at retail stores in my area, so I found these on Amazon for less than what I would have paid in store.

My 3 yr old wears size 8.5 normally, even fits into a size 8--so I read these reviews and ordered up (size 10 D). ""D"" is the normal width and was perfect. These fit with only a little room to spare, so I think I will actually exchange them for size 10.5 D. They run extremely small.

I ordered both the Capezio Daisy 205 Ballet Shoe (Ballet Pink,10 N US Toddler) and the Bloch Dance Bunnyhop Slipper Ballet Flat (Pink,10 D US Toddler). Please see the pictures for comparison that I posted in the image gallery.

Both shoes are extremely well made and have nice leather flexible soles for movement.

The Bloch Bunnyhop shoes win in my comparison. I wanted a PINK ballet slipper to match the other shade of pink that is sold in most dance shops for leotards, tights, etc. These are perfect!! The lining in the Capezio shoes is nice, and I like the name tag. Unfortunately, they look too ""nude"" and won't match the pink leotard and tights that we own. And for that reason I will be sending them back and keeping the Block Bunnyhops.

The other reason that I like the Bunnyhops is that the elastic string can be pulled tight in the front, and it cinches up the rest of the shoe all the way around the ankle, for a tighter fit. The Capezios have an elastic string but it wasn't efficient in cinching up the shoe to make it smaller or tighter. It was just for looks.","These are nude, not pink.

Columbia makes some fantastic shirts, but make sure to order the appropriate size.  I am 510, 195 lbs, and would typically wear a Large in most similar styled (button-up) shirts, but I have to get a Medium in Columbia PFG shirts.  (The Medium is still a moderately loose fit, as the Large is like a tent on me).  Tip number two is that because these shirts are on different sizing scale, many get returned to the Amazon Warehouse, so keep an eye for Amazon Warehouse deals on these shirts (see tips to finds the easiest way to compare prices across sizes and colors at the conclusion of this review).  I have tried the Tamiami II, Bahama II, and Bonehead (AND new Blood & Guts III  see below for updated comparison including the BG3 series) versions of the Columbia PFG shirts, and have been mostly pleased with all of them.  Below I have noted the differences in these styles, for those trying to decide which shirt they may prefer.

TAMIAMI II STYLE (POLY)
The Tamiami II (T2) and the Blood & Guts III (BG3) are my favorite of the aforementioned PFG styles.  The main difference between each of these styles is material.  The T2 & BG3 are 100% polyester (liner and exterior), the Bahama II (Ba2) is nylon (with poly liner), and the Bonehead (BH) is poplin cotton (with poly liner).  The T2 is the thinnest/lightest (most breathable) material of the three styles, has a slightly shinier appearance, and is probably the most wrinkle resistant of the three (as the fabric is less rigid that the nylon Bahama II or cotton Bonehead).  (Update 7/11/16  The Blood & Guts series is also breathable polyester similar to the Tamiami with a slightly different styling, and stain resistant fabric.  See update at end of review for full comparison.)  The T2 has a snap button pocket on top with Velcro pockets underneath on both sides, which I also prefer over the pocket style on the other two (Ba2 & BH have identical pocket styles).  The synthetic T2 and Ba2 both wick moisture and create a cooling effect better than the cotton BH, but the lightness of the T2 makes it by far the coolest wearing of the three.  For outdoor activity in the heat and humidity of summer, it would definitely be my preferred choice.  The long-sleeve version is fantastic for offshore fishing when lightweight sun protection is essential.  The Ta series also does not wrinkle as badly as the Ba and BH series shirts do.  (The PFG apparel which has an SPF rating, such as the Tamiami & Blood/Guts series, has an open fabric weave which is lose enough to allow some penetration of UV through the material itself; which means the material is much more breathable ergo cool feeling, although technically you could get some UV exposure through the shirt.)

BAHAMA II STYLE (NYLON)
The Bahama II is the middle ground between the T2 and the BH.  It is synthetic - similar to the T2, but is nylon exterior shell with a polyester liner, without the cooling open-style weave of the T2 & BG3.  The pockets on the Ba are the same traditional Columbia PFG look as the pockets on the Bonehead.  The slightly more rigid feel of the nylon, also gives the Bahama a more traditional (cotton-look) appearance than the T2.  In a certain respect, the Ba nylon manages moisture better than the BH cotton version  i.e. it evaporates sweat more quickly.  On the other hand, the nylon does not absorb moisture, so if you do perspire heavily, it gives the material a slimy feel that I do not enjoy.  The Bahama also wrinkles worse than any of the other PFG series shirts, so it is my least favorite series.

BONEHEAD STYLE (COTTON)
Most everything has already been covered.  The BH and the aforementioned Ba styles look virtually identical.  Essentially, I like the Bonehead for cooler weather, so I prefer these in long sleeve for fall and winter wear.  I also like the traditional appearance of the Ba and the BH for work wear, but the T2 look I like better for casual.  (The newer Blood & Guts series has the comfort of the Tamiami series, but has a look similar to the Bonehead, so it is my new favorite summertime work shirt.)  The Bonehead long sleeve also makes a great layering option for hunting season, and Sage is a great natural neutral (earth tone) color for this purpose.

UPDATE 7/11/16  BLOOD & GUTS III
When this review was originally posted, I only contrasted the Bahama, Tamiami, and Bonehead series shirts, but recently I have found a new favorite  the Blood & Guts III (BG3).  While the name may not be all that appealing, these are really great shirts.  They have an SPF rating, therefore breathable/open weave, similar to the Tamiami, with a styling that more closely resembles the Bahama & Bonehead series.  The BG3 is also treated for stain resistance, making it a great shirt for fishing, work, and outdoor activities.  Finally, the BG3 does not wrinkle nearly as severely as the Bahama nylon or Bonehead cotton shirts do.  Out of the four PFG series shirts discussed, the BG3 series probably have the tightest fit.  I still wear a medium in the BG3, but the series has a slimmer type cut than the previous versions discussed.

AMAZON PRICE COMPARISON & WAREHOUSE DEALS
I found myself getting very aggravated at the way Amazon lists apparel items with multiple colors, as it can take forever to search through multiple color (and size) options to see the cheapest offerings.  On my iPad version, the color prices are displayed in a list style automatically, but on my PC desktop I would have to select each color/size to see the price options.  I finally found a simpler way.
Follow these steps:
>Select a color and size option for the shirt.
>Look on the right hand side of the screen to see if there are multiple offers for this garment.  If so, select the new and used from (or new if no used offerings available) icon, which will take you to a list view screen.  (There must be multiple offerings for the exact size and color selected for this option to appear, so if you do not see the new and used from hyper-link, then select another size/color combination till the link appears.)
>In the list view screen, select your size and click the lowest offer for each icon beside the color selector.  This will display the cheapest offering for each color shirt in that size, so you can quickly see which colors are the cheapest.  Also, this view will show any Amazon Warehouse Deals available.  As mentioned in the first paragraph, these shirts get returned often due to sizing issues, and many times the Warehouse deals are shirts that were tried on, then immediately returned for a smaller size.

I bought this long sleeve fishing shirt to help climb Mesoamerican pyramids in high humidity. The fit of the shirt was perfect for me. (WARNING: I kept the MEDIUM SIZED shirt, I returned the small). I had plenty of room and it was well ventilated. Sleeve length was perfect and there was plenty of room around the abdominal area. Even though it was extremely warm & humid I decided to wear a long sleeve shirt to keep sun exposure to a minimum. I noticed most of the local men wore long sleeve shirt and long pants too. Most of the tourists wore short sleeve shirts and short pants. I spoke with some of the tourists (from US, England, Netherland, and Germany). I was surprised to find that many fair-skin caucasians from Northern Europe did not have problems with the sun exposure. They seemed very comfortable in short sleeve shirt and short pants.

Buying apparel online is always a guessing game, but I'm pleased to say that I'm more than satisfied with the Columbia Bonehead Long Sleeve Shirt. Overall, the construction seems solid and, since I'm not hard on my clothes, should give me several years of wear. In ""sport"" shirts like these, I always buy the long sleeve versions since you have the option of rolling up the sleeves and using the tabs to keep them in place. The pockets are plentiful and roomy. I also like the fact that the collar isn't button-down but held in place by velcro. While that seemed odd at first, I realized that it's two less buttons to worry about falling off. The back venting works well, especially in breezy weather. I always wear mine over a v-neck all-cotton t-shirt (to keep perspiration and anti-antiperspirant off the shirt) and it still helps keep me cool with the exception of the very hottest of days. The fabric isn't the smoothest, but it's certainly not anywhere as bad as the cheap stuff. As for fit, I was pleased to find they fit me true to size. I'm a US size 40 in men's suits and the medium is just right. In shirts of this kind, I've bought cheaper ones (half the price) and they shrank far too much after several washings. In hot weather, that's not a good thing...so I'd stay on the safe side and be satisfied if you buy one and it's slightly large. You will stay cooler that way. For laundering, I use a standard Tide ""pod"" and wash on gentle cycle with like colors or hand wash with Woolite. For drying, I always hang these to dry. If I wash them in the evening, by morning they are dry. For a neater look, I press over them with a warm iron. I was so pleased with my first one that I bought four more in several colors. Paired with a well-built pair of khaki/black/navy ripstop cargo pants and Gore-Tex Timberland boots, and I'm set for the trip. What's my outing? Not fishing. I'm a storm chaser and Skywarn spotter with over 30 years of experience in the field. After that long in a variety of weather, you get picky about the quality of clothing you wear. When I've gotten quite wet from rain, these have dried quickly. The pockets are great for batteries, camera lenses, hand held wind meters, and other small items you want close at hand. In the hot steamy flatlands of the Great Plains, these keep me cool while giving me the option of rolling down the sleeves if it gets a bit chilly. I now wear these shirts exclusively on my long trips and am glad to highly recommend them with five stars.

Update on July 29, 2016: I still would give these shirts five stars and highly recommend them but wanted to let potential buyers know about two problems they may encounter. During washing in a washing machine, the collar velcro tabs tend to get caught on the white inner mesh lining which, if you pull too hard, can snag. I've resorted to making sure the collar is firmly ""closed"" before washing and this seems to help somewhat. Another problem I've encountered by accident involves the collar velcro tab that is sewn to the shirt. This is the half of the collar velcro closure that is sewn to the shirt. If you're iron is too hot or comes in contact with this half of the velcro closure, it will melt the velcro and make it impossible for the collar to stay in place. Personally speaking, I wouldn't mind a button-down collar to remedy this situation. I use an iron on a low setting and have ""melted"" tabs on two different shirts. As long as you keep your iron away from the velcro, you shouldn't have any problems. I just wanted to pass those two tips along to folks considering buying one of these. The other styles of Columbia shirts are excellent as well and I highly recommend them all.",Best Versatile Shirt For Warm To Hot Weather With Plentiful Pockets.,1426809600,

Fit: baggy. I'm a 41 chest, purchased medium, and it felt very large around the waist, ok on shoulders. Good for guys with beer bellies (no insult intended), and only for wearing outside the pants.
I had my wife sew and trim, and it fits me perfect.
Durability: excellent. Much better than the tamiami shirts, which pulled easily and balled up with friction.
Comfort: Very good. I sweat just thinking of sweat. My regular dry-fit golf shirts do a superb job of keeping me dry and comfy, and this shirt can't match them, but the Columbia shirt is almost as good.
In all, I would certainly buy again.","Awesome, durable comfort",1403308800,
4,64,TRUE,"10 1, 2015",AUKQYNHAWG6MS,B0002XSXWW,"{'Size:': ' Small', 'Color:': ' Commando'}",Matt,"I'm a big fan of Columbia ""breather-back"" shirts. In the hot Texas summers these things are no joke- they really do keep you cool. For no good reason, I only had one of these for many years and I only used it for fishing. This past summer I snapped out of that nonsense and started buying more and wearing them all over. Here's  my take on the different shirts, hope this helps you. (for reference I am 5'8"", 175#, 32"" waist and usually wear either an athletic-cut large shirt or a medium if it's cut normally...yes, I live in size hell)

Bonehead: This shirt is 100% cotton and is very tough. Makes a great work shirt. It wrinkles easily and has the traditional PFG assortment of pockets on the front. It is the quintessential PFG shirt. It does not fly under the radar but it looks fine for what it is. I have several of these and if you can get them less than $15 that's a great deal. Given the pros of the other shirts, however, I must say this style is my least favorite (but still a great shirt, and my go-to work shirt). I always get a small in this style and it's still roomy at that. It's cut VERY large.

Bahama II: Much like the Bonehead in terms of pockets, but it's made of a synthetic fabric. Breathes better and wrinkles less but can still wrinkle. The ""Super Bahama"" version has a print rather than solid colors. Heavier material than the Tamiami. I wear a small in this shirt as well. Not super lightweight but tougher and can be used as a work shirt.

Tamiami II: This seems like a refinement of the Bonehead and Bahama. Very light cloth, kind of parachute-like. Different pockets. This, to me, is the coolest (temperature-wise) shirt of the bunch. The ""Super Tamiami"" is the printed version. I wear a small in this one as well and it's my favorite for very hot weather but I would be very hesitant to wear it for work applications. Not as tough as the Bonehead or Bahama. Pretty much wrinkle-free.

Baitcaster: Lightweight like the Tamiami but different cut and different pockets. It's kind of a cleaner version of the Tamiami, however, because of the cut I wear a medium in this rather than the small in most of the others. I tried a small and it would button but was tight in the shoulders.

Low-Drag Offshore: Another lightweight version with far more conventional pockets and a very clean look. Some colors have contrasting stitching which, in my opinion, looks sharp. The sizing on this is smaller than the Bonehead/Bahama/Tamiami but slightly larger than the Baitcaster. I ordered a small and it fits, barely. By far my favorite design. When I order another I may or may not order up a size to a medium.

So there you go. If I seem addicted to these shirts it's because I am. In a hot climate you may be able to find a cooler shirt but if one exists I don't know about it. Retail you can expect to pay anywhere from $30-$60 for these but if you keep an eye out on Amazon getting them as cheap as $11 isn't unheard of. Money well-spent if you spend a lot of time outside.","Love these shirts: Overview of the Bonehead, Baitcaster, Bahama, Low-Drag and Tamiami",1443657600,

The wallet is good quality - especially for the price point.  It also seems sturdy enough.  Time will tell. Also, there is a strong ""shoe polish"" odor if that might bother you.  I'm hoping it goes away quickly..

You'd think it would be straight forward to put it on - especially since I had a similar one as a young man that somehow disappeared over the years.  Anyway, not so.  Looking at the description on how to put it on it turns out that what you read isn't for this wallet.  For example, there is no elastic strap and there is no loop to attached to your belt (not that I would).  As it turns out, the leather straps that reaches across to your other shoulder to help keep the wallet on came oriented in the wrong direction (and the rivets connecting it were very tight and hard to rotate 180 degrees like they needed to be).  The funny thing is all the pictures associated with this wallet turn out to have these straps pointing in the wrong direction! You'll notice, there are no pictures of it being worn.  Once I took care of fixing the straps I was able to put it on easily.

Size - lot's of people talk about the size.  I'm 5'10"" - 190 pounds - wear a 42 regular.  I don't think it would fit anyone bigger.  It's comfortable enough and I have it on the largest hole it can be.",Good shoulder holster at a good price point..,1395619200,

If you look at the Left boot inside behind the label is a reflective sticker that has Uggs written on it with Sun's which will help let you know if they are real. The same sticker should be on the box. As of 2013 Uggs changed the security feature when you turn the boot 90 degree's the sticker will change from Black to White. You can go to the Uggs website to see the pictures of the stickers and get a more detailed explanation. Depending on what year your boots are made will depend on the security feature.

Next Sizing....
I usually wear a size 7/7.5 pending on the shoe. The Uggs site tells if that if you are in between sizes to order DOWN as their boot tends to run large, torn between a Big Kids 5 or 6 I ordered the BIG Kids 5. They fit PERFECT, a little snug, snug with a thick sock on BUT.... Uggs form to your feet which is what makes them soooo comfy, so after a few wears the snugness will hug my tootsie's just right with socks on. I know some like to wear with no sock but I have to wear socks.

Now to tell you what you probably already know... Uggs... LOVES them, how could you not, they are like having pillows on your feet, they are like walking up a staircase of clouds taking you to HEAVEN. Yea they are that comfortable. When they first came out I swore I wouldn't jump on the bandwagon so much so that I would wear the EMU and BearPaws or as I would freely admit ""Fuggs"".

Uggs are without a doubt the BEST boot in this type of style, you know the sheepskin, warm & fuzzy, cozy & comfy, that you can wear with sweats, jeans or shorts because they feel that AMAZING on. I have worn BearPaw, EMU and other popular competitors and without a doubt Uggs is definitely the way to go. The popular competitors seem to over do it with either the boots are too heavy on the feet or they don't given enough support.

If you are looking to keep the feetsie's warm, want comfort and something you can wear with anything these are the boots you want. Don't settle for the knocks off whether they are they are unknowns or popular competitors. Ugg's LOVES them :)",Uggs are like having Pillows of Happiness on your Feet :),1385683200,

On the one hand, I love them, I love this style of boot. Unfortunately there is some thick layer of coating or treatment on the surface of the leather and the sole material is a bit strange. My grandfather passed an old set of black corcoran jump boots he wore in the Army to me, so I had some experience with this type and brand of boot. With these brown boots, I was expecting a more natural look to the leather. The reason I got these boots was because I needed a set of brown shoes to go with a suit and having brown jump boots while wearing a business suit is just my style of doing something conventional in an unconventional way. I am weird like that. The boots run just a little large, until I used a set of orthotics (Pedag Viva Outdoor, order about a half size, or better, full size larger) and now they are a dream. I polished them up a little, not quite spitshine, because of their intended use. I do like them and they are growing on me more with time, but a set of brown boots with natural grain visible as in the old black pair would be unbelievably amazing.

Be it the initial stiffness or complexity of the break in period or whatever it may be, my opinion (based on my analysis) is this; These boots are not for 47 year old computer technicians who wear their grandad's 101 Airborne uniform on sundays to play war with other 47 year old computer technicians... These boots are for people who need good, American made boots that will last for a long period of time and can be easily repaired after heavy, extensive use.

 Yes, these boots hurt like hell to break in. Just wearing them is NOT going to do the trick. When I purchased these boots I filled them with warm water, dumped them out, pulled them on over two pairs of socks, walked around for an hour, coated them in saddle soap, bent them every-which-way they could possibly (and naturally) bend, jogged in them, ran in them, bla bla bla. I repeated this for a week and then I wore them to work. I polished them up nightly and worked mink oil into the leather with a rag. After a couple weeks of pain and blisters these boots formed to my feet like moccasins and became amongst the most comfortable boots I had ever worn but it took time.

 You need to understand before purchasing these boots that these are what boots used to be. They are of a quality no longer available in any other brand of footwear. These were issued to US troops in WW2 and worn for a year, sometimes two years straight.  The same boot on the same foot, every day for the duration of the war and they lasted beautifully. Thats why people buy these boots, and aside from the lack of a ""C"" stamped into the leather (a common complaint that somehow renders low ratings) these boots are unchanged from those used in the war.

Bottom line; if you work construction and need good boots to hold up to the rigors of the trades, or you just want something that you can rely on for years to come for other activities then buy these boots. Buying American is never a bad decision.

I stand, walk, move, lift and generally never sit down for 8 hours a day six days a week. Before these boots I tried many others and never even consider a different pair now.

Yeah, stubborn,  but I love the style.  I decided I needed a little bit of a change so ordered these because of the contrast in material, they looked pretty cool but still my beloved jump boot look.

Corcoran was purchased by another company since the last pair of their boots I've owned, and I noticed these don't have the vibram soles my Corcoran field boots had (those are excellent boots).

I have some of those tactical boots that use cordura, but wasn't sure how that would work on this classic design.  Plus these are about 40-50% more expensive than typical 'police' boots, and heavier and less sneaker like.  I've worn many jump boots, and spent years wearing the original design (and still wear some).  Those take a while to break in, have poor traction, and look amazing with excellent support.

These are definitely not really jump boots, but I like them a lot.  They cordura means there is essentially no break in time, but you really need to make sure you get the right boots, particularly with respect to width.  If they fit, they will feel awesome from the first second you put them on.  They do provide some ankle support and toe protection.  They shine easily once you remove the gunk they are shipped with.  BTW I have always stripped my boots before shining the first time, but with these the stuff that was on them was thicker and a bit greasier than any boot had before.  Plan to spend some time cleaning them up first.  But once that was done, Kiwi and water was enough to make them nearly like mirrors.  Against the fabric body of the boot, the cap and heel look amazing.

They aren't running shoes by any stretch of the imagination, and I don't think they are appropriate for those who get into foot pursuits, but they are otherwise really some of the best boots I've ever had, and seem to be very durable.

I have stood by this brand for almost 30 years.  It served me well in my military career as well as my law enforcement career.  This particular boot is my first with the zipper.  I have decided to spoil myself with that.  I received them yesterday and am currently breaking them in.  for those of you that do not know how to do this, I would like to pass this on.  It was taught to me by a leather smiths son that I served with over in England.
soak the boots over not in water by placing them in the bath tub and filling them up.  (not the tub, the boots)
the next morning, empty if there is any water left in them and place them on your bare feet.
wear them till dry.
get rubbing alcohol and remove the factory dye.  the leather should turn brownish yellow.  it does not have to be completely removed.  so it may have a spotty look.  get some 400 grit sand paper and smooth out the leather if needed.  (CAUTION:  DO NOT SAND ANY STITCHING)  this will break the boot down.
apply Kiwi Leather Dye.  (you can find that on Amazon too) do this generously.  there will be some bleeding for a while so expect your socks to be black.
after the dye is applied, I prefer Kiwi Parade Gloss.  some like to mix Kiwi Neutral in as well.  that is fine.  I get the same results with parade gloss.
I take all my old parade gloss to do this:  Melt the gloss down (BE CAREFUL ITS MESSY)  the best way to melt it down is to use an old skillet and set the can (opened) in the skillet and turn the heat on medium.  it will turn to liquid.  CAREFULLY take the polish somewhere your wife approves and use an old cotton t shirt (WHITE) to apply to your boots.  rub in till the boot has soaked up and has a layer of polish on it.  set boot aside and let dry.  repeat the above steps to the second boot.
get a spray bottle and mix 1/3 alcohol and 2/3 water.  spray your boots down and brush shine them.  this will take some time and effort and will leave a nice high gloss.  for some, that is enough.  for those that like to stand out, spit shine till the boot looks like a mirror your commander could shave in.
I will say the one down side to doing this is wearing the boots with bare feet is no fun.  especially when it is still cold outside.  I recommend waiting for cold weather and insure you have the day to wear them till dry and try not to do anything while wearing them that will damage them.  I can not wait till warm weather so I am sucking it up and dealing with cold feet for the day.
once I have completed my process, I will try to post a photo of the finished product on here.

I plan to wear these in the late afternoons and evenings in Ireland, walking around towns or to pubs.  I have hiking boots for the day hikes we plan.",Sizing is tricky,1460419200,

I've been wearing Merrell's knee high waterproof boots since fall/winter and decided to buy these because I trust the brand, and they seemed light and comfortable for walking on pavement. Just received  these yesterday and as soon as I put them on, I was like, 'where have you been all my life.' I wore them without socks at the end of a work day and they give me enough wiggle room that I could wear a thin or slightly thicker pair of socks and have no problem with the fit. No need for breaking in because the material is flexible and moves with your foot. I'm usually an 8 or 8.5 and chose the 8.5 to ensure the best fit when my feet swell at the end of the day. Very comfortable and happy!",Light and comfortable for walking on pavement,1457568000,

But I noticed some of the reviewers said they thought the shoes were a little too wide, and it seemed to me that would work for me. Also, they offer free return shipping. So I figured, why not?

I'm so glad I did! They are super comfortable and I love that the soles are almost like my old Nike's, yet the tops are light, stretchy and breathable. I've been wearing them all day and my only regret is I'll have to take them off before I get into bed!","Wide width wearers, these will work!",1456790400,
